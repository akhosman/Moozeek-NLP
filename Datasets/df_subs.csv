lanadelrey,True,False,"I've spent a long time trying to understand the meaning behind this song. At first, I was satisfied with it being just what the name implies: Lana wishes to take risks, but her desire to stay alive regulates said risks. However, some lyrics, as well as the music video and the music itself, contradict this interpretation. The first instance occurs in the chorus: They say only the good die young  That just ain't right  'Cause we're having too much fun  Too much fun tonight. So in the first two lines of this excerpt, we have Lana and The Weeknd contradicting the common expression, ""Only the good die young,"" which to me implies, 'This statement is incorrect because we are bad, and we, too, will die young because we are engaging in risky behaviors.' This idea is further supported by a line from the next verse: We dance on the H of the Hollywood sign  'Til we run out of breath, gotta dance 'til we die. This helps lead up to a dramatic scene where  the Hollywood sign and waits as The Weeknd walks over to her. He hugs her, and she only breaks the embrace after the lyric, ""There's no stopping now, green lights forever."" With this, she approaches the slant on the D of the Hollywood sign as a stripped version of the prechorus plays. She slides and falls to the ground, waking up surrounded by flowers with The Weeknd beside her. The camera zooms out to reveal that they are on a planet covered with these flowers that it shaped as a peace sign. ..... With this in mind, I can only interpret the song as follows: Lana and The Weeknd begin the song as stated earlier. They are risk-takers and want to live life to its fullest, but they also love life and understand that if they live too hard, they will cease to live at all. So they begrudgingly self-regulate. But throughout the video, they realize that their lust is not for life at all, but rather, for each other. Deep-down, they see life as a means to an end and not as an end in and of itself: it is just a way for them to be together. As their romantic feelings grow, they become increasingly dissatisfied with the constraints that life puts on them, so Lana proposes a suicide pact. She quickly runs to, well, do it (I'm not sure if they're actually on the Hollywood sign or if that's just there to symbolize all their risky behavior), and The Weeknd hesitantly follows. When she gets close to the end, The Weeknd reminds her of his love for her before... yeah. ""Green lights forever"" is used to remind her of the new freedoms they would have in the afterlife, nobody to tell them no. She had been worried about him not following through and leaving her alone in the afterlife, and he had been concerned that there wouldn't be an afterlife at all, but when she awakens, she is happy to see him beside her in their new world.

lanadelrey,True,False,"Hello, I re-listened to Blue Bannisters and Chemtrails back to back again and I noticed a reoccurring theme about Lana: Despite hating fame, she still chooses it even if it means being single and alone forever. And I wondered why? This might sound out there but I gather that the reason is because of a possible miscarriage with Barry. Here‚Äôs where I noticed it,  Cherry Blossom The lyrics in question:  What you don‚Äôt tell no one you can tell me and,  Little ghost, blonde hair with lemonade tea and,  You feel afraid, Mommy is there And last,  I push you high Angelina, on your sycamore tree Analysis: Cherry Blossom was originally written in 2013 when Lana and Barrie were together. As the lyrics indicate, she has a secret only both of them know. Given the ‚Äòghost‚Äô lyrics, and referring to herself as ‚Äòmommy‚Äô, it likely indicate that at one point, she was going to be a mother and lost that child. While it might be a stretch, with the tone of this song, I believe she‚Äôs envisioning her unborn child and pushing her on a swing. Angelina was the chosen name? This is where my train of thought went. ‚Äî-  Dark But Just A Game  And that‚Äôs the price of fame, a tale as time as old as you‚Äôd be And also,  A pretty little fool to think exceptions to the rules She can‚Äôt make exceptions for the relationship because of the way fame is. Another telling line from this song,  And God I loved to sing but nothing came from either one but pain And also,  So I‚Äôm not going to change, I‚Äôll stay the same. No rose left on the vines. Don‚Äôt even want what‚Äôs mine, much less the fame I believe this is the most telling line in both albums, given that the struggle of fame leads to the end of her romantic relationships. However, despite knowing that both brings pain, the silver lining in this is that singing only constant, and despite fame, she won‚Äôt do anything to change it. She‚Äôll pick fame over romantic relationships every-time because singing is guaranteed, where as a long lasting relationship, is not. ‚Äî-  Conclusion: It sucks that these are the options she has to choose from ‚Äî fame or love. But she still chooses fame. Given how she showed us how screwey toxic relationships are in Ultraviolence, it doesn‚Äôt surprise me that she‚Äôd pick the toxic-confusion that comes with fame. Given the lyrical content of Cherry Blossom, it‚Äôs likely she was on the path to having a life she once envisioned, but lost it. And due to how life‚Äôs circumstances are, she never got that life. Why would she give up everything for a chance at a life that she already lost, just to lose it again? Despite being officially released after Dark But Just A Game, Cherry Blossom was made before Dark But Just A Game by around 7 years. It‚Äôs where the journey was, and this is where she currently is. Either way. Chemtrails and Blue Banisters are both amazing albums and I‚Äôm glad we got more insight to her. There are complicated and haunting songs on both albums, and believe both tell a story about how choosing their life she has isn‚Äôt always great. I‚Äôm glad we got Lana.","An Observation about Lana through Cherry Blossom and Dark But Just A Game: After her relationship with Barrie, she‚Äôll always choose fame over love due to a possible

chosen name thi is where my train of thought went dark but just a game and that s the price of fame a tale as time as old as you d be and also a pretti littl fool to think except to the rule she can t make except for the relationship becaus of the way fame is anoth tell line from thi song and god i love to sing but noth came from either one but pain and also so i m not go to chang i ll stay the same no rose left on the vine don t even want what s mine much less the fame i believ thi is the most tell line in both album given that the struggl of fame lead to the end of her romant relationship howev despit know that both bring pain the silver line in thi is that sing onli constant and despit fame she won t do anyth to chang it she ll pick fame over romant relationship everi time becaus sing is guarante where as a long last relationship is not conclus it suck that these are the option she ha to choos from fame or love but she still choos fame given how she show us how screwey toxic relationship are in ultraviol it doesn t surpris me that she d pick the toxic confus that come with fame given the lyric content of cherri blossom it s like she wa on the path to have a life she onc envis but lost it and due to how life s circumst are she never got that life whi would she give up everyth for a chanc at a life that she alreadi lost just to lose it again despit be offici releas after dark but just a game cherri blossom wa made befor dark but just a game by around 7 year it s where the journey wa and thi is where she current is either way chemtrail and blue banist are both amaz album and i m glad we got more insight to her there are complic and haunt song on both album and believ both tell a stori about how choos their life she ha isn t alway great i m glad we got lana,an observ about lana through cherri blossom and dark but just a game after her relationship with barri she ll alway choos fame over love due to a possibl miscarriag,Hello I re listened to Blue Bannisters and Chemtrails back to back again and I noticed a reoccurring theme about Lana Despite hating fame she still chooses it even if it mean being single and alone forever And I wondered why This might sound out there but I gather that the reason is because of a possible miscarriage with Barry Here s where I noticed it Cherry Blossom The lyric in question What you don t tell no one you can tell me and Little ghost blonde hair with lemonade tea and You feel afraid Mommy is there And last I push you high Angelina on your sycamore tree Analysis Cherry Blossom wa originally written in 2013 when Lana and Barrie were together As the lyric indicate she ha a secret only both of them know Given the ghost lyric and referring to herself a mommy it likely indicate that at one point she wa going to be a mother and lost that child While it might be a stretch with the tone of this song I believe she s envisioning her unborn child and pushing her on a swing Angelina wa the chosen name This is where my train of thought went Dark But Just A Game And that s the price of fame a tale a time a old a you d be And also A pretty little fool to think exception to the rule She can t make exception for the relationship because of the way fame is Another telling line from this song And God I loved to sing but nothing came from either one but pain And also So I m not going to change I ll stay the same No rose left on the vine Don t even want what s mine much le the fame I believe this is the most telling line in both album given that the struggle of fame lead to the end of her romantic relationship However despite knowing that both brings pain the silver lining in this is that singing only constant and despite fame she won t do anything to change it She ll pick fame over romantic relationship every time because singing is guaranteed where a a long lasting relationship is not Conclusion It suck that these are the option she ha to choose from fame or love But she still chooses fame Given how she showed u how screwey toxic relationship are in Ultraviolence it doesn t surprise me that she d pick the toxic confusion that come with fame Given the lyrical content of Cherry Blossom it s likely she wa on the path to having a life she once envisioned but lost it And due to how life s circumstance are she never got that life Why would she give up everything for a chance at a life that she already lost just to lose it again Despite being officially released after Dark But Just A Game Cherry Blossom wa made before Dark But Just A Game by around 7 year It s where the journey wa and this is where she currently is Either way Chemtrails and Blue Banisters are both amazing album and I m glad we got more insight to her There are complicated and haunting song on both album and believe both tell a story about how choosing their life she ha isn t always great I m glad we got Lana,An Observation about Lana through Cherry Blossom and Dark But Just A Game After her relationship with Barrie she ll always choose fame over love due to a possible miscarriage,Hello I listened Blue Bannisters Chemtrails I noticed reoccurring theme Lana Despite hating fame chooses mean

lanadelrey,True,False,"Dont get me wrong, I love Lana del rey, but there are some things that I dont like about her songs‚Äôs lyrics... her songs are harder to understand compared to other singers‚Äôs songs. The lyrics are not straight forward (if you get what I mean). (I have seen another post on this subreddit before, that said the same thing i am sayingm) First, it can be hard to tell what the song is about (whether break up/unrequited love/love triangle/personal issues/etc) Because usually only a small of the lyrics of a typical lana song are about the main topic/issue of the song, and the rest of the song is about other things like glamour/makeup/money/USA cities and so, while in for example, Adele‚Äôs songs (as the other post said), usually 99% ofher lyrics are about the main topic .. i hope you got what I am trying to say. Take an example: her song heroin. the song is about her loved one who died because of heroin (If i interpret it correctly) Yet, the first part of the song has nothing to do with the main topic: Topanga is hot tonight, the city by the bay Has movie stars and liquor stores and soft decay The rumbling from distant shores sends me to sleep But the facts of life, can sometimes make it hard to dream Life rocked me like M√∂tley Grabbed me by the ribbons in my hair Life rocked me, ultra-softly Like the heavy metal that you wear . It can be very hard from the first glance to tell what the song is about. The main topic in her songs are usually hidden inside a bunch of lyrics about fame,glamour,money,alcohol,roses,etc Also I dont like the excessive use of real names in it‚Äôs songs because it makes her songs so unrelatable (blue banisters, I am looking at you! ‚ÄúJenny jumped into the pool, she was swimming with nikki lane‚Äù, i really feel like the song would be way better without this line.)

The pre-chorus denounces these views as the subject revises their life philosophies, believing that people can often exceed our own expectations because we are far more powerful than we might think. The subject wants to gain agency in their own life and hopes that they can become a dependable person. Finally, the chorus solidifies the message that we can‚Äôt hide in the hopes that others will be able to fix things for us. Despite the adversities we endure, we need to be willing to face them head on. Of course we have no idea what the fuck is going to happen next, and we won‚Äôt always be prepared for it no matter what precursory adjustments we might try and make. But the most crucial element is that we allow ourselves to be confronted with change, because quite often ‚Äî change is good. Thoughts: Change is one of those Lana tracks where you have to be a very particular frame of mind to listen to it. I‚Äôll skip it quite often when it comes on shuffle, but never when I listen to LFL in its entirety. The entire landscape painted by Heroin - Change - Get Free happens to be some of Lana‚Äôs best storytelling. What‚Äôs another thing that‚Äôs quite remarkable of this song is that it‚Äôs applicable to so many life situations. I know this song was written following the 2016 election and ensuing fear of what were to happen with the world, but if you told me Lana wrote this in the worst of lockdown last year I would have believed you. It‚Äôs such an important addition to Lana‚Äôs discography, because it‚Äôs a standout moment that illustrates the change in Lana‚Äôs songwriting abilities.

lanadelrey,True,False,"I apologize if this is really incoherent but I wanted to present evidence pointing to what I feel are the most likely interpretations of the song Cherry Blossom by Lana Del Rey. Please note that I am analyzing the lyrics objectively as if the narrator is their own separate person completely removed from what we personally know about the author (Lana Del Rey) in real life. There are however instances where the author‚Äôs personal life are relevant to the interpretation of a narrator, such as when songs are autobiographical. We do know that Lana Del Rey bases a lot of her songs on personal experiences she‚Äôs had, so it is implied that much of her discography is semi-autobiographical. ‚Äî Cherry blossoms: Flower once in the spring but only for a very short time, one or two weeks Sycamore tree: Symbol for eternity, protection The juxtaposition of describing a ‚Äúlittle ghost‚Äù as a cherry blossom (which are characteristically fleeting and short-lived) on a sycamore (that symbolizes eternity) suggests to me that the song is addressed to somebody that was in the narrator‚Äôs life for a short time, but remains in the narrator‚Äôs thoughts. It‚Äôs someone that the narrator dwells on, has hypothetical conversations with. The person is characterized as a ghost. Ghosts can refer to the spirit of someone who has passed away, or metaphorically to mean the memory of somebody or a past state/phase of life. The little ghost is also implicitly identified with the narrator, physically/spiritually. The ghost is described as tall, tan, and blonde. These traits are mentioned standalone and not juxtaposed against other hypothetical traits, which leads me to believe they are mentioned because the speaker also identifies with these traits. This is further supported when looking at the greater lyrical context of the whole album‚Äîin Text Book the narrator mentions that their past self used to be blonde &amp; in Arcadia the narrator characterizes [herself] as 5‚Äô8‚Äù, which is generally understood to be tall for a woman. All of these things rolled together in the context of the other lyrics in the verses combined with the narrator calling herself Mommy in the bridge indicate to me that the narrator is speaking to either 1.	the memory of the narrator‚Äôs child now grown up 2.	the memory of the narrator‚Äôs child now passed away 3.	the memory of another child the narrator was close with in a motherly capacity 4.	the memory of the narrator‚Äôs past self whether that be their literal child that passed away as a child or the ‚Äòchild‚Äô of someone now grown-up, that they personally identified with or had some kind of relationship or connection to. Finally, the little, blonde ghost is named by the narrator as Angelina. I find it interesting that the name Angelina is derived from the word angel, which the narrator also identifies themselves with in the songs Arcadia and Black Bathing Suit. Is this name the child‚Äôs literal name or is it symbolic? If it‚Äôs symbolic, is the identification of the child with angels a reference to a deceased spirit (popular connotation) or a reference to an innocent/pure state (another popular meaning, also the way it is used in Arcadia and Black Bathing Suit) Those who interpret the song to be about the narrator speaking to the memory of their child self or their inner child would probably say the name ‚ÄúAngelina‚Äù to be the narrator‚Äôs name or a substitute for the narrator‚Äôs name. In the context of the greater album, the author Lana Del Rey changes her sister‚Äôs name ‚ÄúCaroline‚Äù to ‚ÄúCarolina‚Äù in the title of the biographical song Sweet Carolina. ‚ÄúAngelina‚Äù is lexically and visually similar to the name Elizabeth, which we know to be the real name of the author of the song. But then why is the child‚Äôs name ‚ÄòAngelina‚Äô only introduced in the final verse, specifically after the bridge where the narrator identifies herself as Mommy? If the narrator is trying to convey that she herself is Angelina grown up, my personal feeling is that it would make more sense to call out her name earlier on near the beginning of the song. I believe that the name reveal at the end of the song is therefore done for dramatic effect, for emphasis. It‚Äôs meant to specifically draw attention back to the implicit connection between the child with angelic qualities‚Äîeither their ‚Äòpure‚Äô or ‚Äòdeceased‚Äô nature‚Äîas suggested by the name ‚ÄúAngelina‚Äù itself. Given the context of everything else, I feel like I‚Äôm sadly inclined to believe it makes more sense that the dramatic effect of revealing the ghost‚Äôs name as ‚ÄúAngelina‚Äù at the end of the song serves to suggest the deceased nature of the subject of the song, rather than being the literal name of a concrete person or the name of the narrator herself as a child. In the meta-context of the full album, Lana Del Rey has referenced a complicated relationship with motherhood due to her relationship with her mother. We know that the narrator in the album had a strained relationship with their mother and by extension, motherhood. The narrator was abused by their mother (Wildflower Wildfire). The narrator expresses that they want to symbolically rectify or karmically ‚Äúright‚Äù their mother‚Äôs wrongs by they themselves living in a different, more genuine, more compassionate way (Text Book, Black Bathing Suit). The narrator references her dislike of the season Spring in the title track Blue Banisters. Is this due to Mother‚Äôs Day being in the spring or is it potentially due to some connection to Cherry Blossom, as cherry blossoms are symbolic of spring? If this aversion to Spring is connected to something within Cherry Blossom, to me it would also logically be connected to the narrator‚Äôs identification with the title ‚ÄúMommy‚Äù. In summary, based on my lyrical analysis and the greater context of the whole album, the track Cherry Blossom is most likely a song about a narrator speaking to either 1.	the ghost of their child who has passed away, grieving about the hypothetical life the child will miss, the grief compounded by the narrator‚Äôs implied difficult relationship with their own mother 2.	the ghost of their ‚Äòformer self‚Äô, the narrator mourning the loss of their own childhood due to their volatile relationship with their mother.",Literary analysis of ‚ÄúCherry Blossom‚Äù,t5_2tegk,1639977049,1.0,cowboyclown,0,i

pass away as a child or the child of someon now grown up that they person identifi with or had some kind of relationship or connect to final the littl blond ghost is name by the narrat as angelina i find it interest that the name angelina is deriv from the word angel which the narrat also identifi themselv with in the song arcadia and black bath suit is thi name the child s liter name or is it symbol if it s symbol is the identif of the child with angel a refer to a deceas spirit popular connot or a refer to an innoc pure state anoth popular mean also the way it is use in arcadia and black bath suit those who interpret the song to be about the narrat speak to the memori of their child self or their inner child would probabl say the name angelina to be the narrat s name or a substitut for the narrat s name in the context of the greater album the author lana del rey chang her sister s name carolin to carolina in the titl of the biograph song sweet carolina angelina is lexic and visual similar to the name elizabeth which we know to be the real name of the author of the song but then whi is the child s name angelina onli introduc in the final vers specif after the bridg where the narrat identifi herself as mommi if the narrat is tri to convey that she herself is angelina grown up my person feel is that it would make more sens to call out her name earlier on near the begin of the song i believ that the name reveal at the end of the song is therefor done for dramat effect for emphasi it s meant to specif draw attent back to the implicit connect between the child with angel qualiti either their pure or deceas natur as suggest by the name angelina itself given the context of everyth els i feel like i m sadli inclin to believ it make more sens that the dramat effect of reveal the ghost s name as angelina at the end of the song serv to suggest the deceas natur of the subject of the song rather than be the liter name of a concret person or the name of the narrat herself as a child in the meta context of the full album lana del rey ha referenc a complic relationship with motherhood due to her relationship with her mother we know that the narrat in the album had a strain relationship with their mother and by extens motherhood the narrat wa abus by their mother wildflow wildfir the narrat express that they want to symbol rectifi or karmic right their mother s wrong by they themselv live in a differ more genuin more compassion way text book black bath suit the narrat refer her dislik of the season spring in the titl track blue banist is thi due to mother s day be in the spring or is it potenti due to some connect to cherri blossom as cherri blossom are symbol of spring if thi avers to spring is connect to someth within cherri blossom to me it would also logic be connect to the narrat s identif with the titl mommi in summari base on my lyric analysi and the greater context of the whole album the track cherri blossom is most like a song about a narrat speak to either 1 the ghost of their child who ha pass away griev about the hypothet life the child will miss the grief compound by the narrat s impli difficult relationship with their own mother 2 the ghost of their former self the narrat mourn the loss of their own childhood due to their volatil relationship with their mother,literari analysi of cherri blossom,I apologize if this is really incoherent but I wanted to present evidence pointing to what I feel are the most likely interpretation of the song Cherry Blossom by Lana Del Rey Please note that I am analyzing the lyric objectively a if the narrator is their own separate person completely removed from what we personally know about the author Lana Del Rey in real life There are however instance where the author s personal life are relevant to the interpretation of a narrator such a when song are autobiographical We do know that Lana Del Rey base a lot of her song on personal experience she s had so it is implied that much of her discography is semi autobiographical Cherry blossom Flower once in the spring but only for a very short time one or two week Sycamore tree Symbol for eternity protection The juxtaposition of describing a little ghost a a cherry blossom which are characteristically fleeting and short lived on a sycamore that symbolizes eternity suggests to me that the song is addressed to somebody that wa in the narrator s life for a short time but remains in the narrator s thought It s someone that the narrator dwells on ha hypothetical conversation with The person is characterized a a ghost Ghosts can refer to the spirit of someone who ha passed away or metaphorically to mean the memory of somebody or a past state phase of life The little ghost is also implicitly identified with the narrator physically spiritually The ghost is described a tall tan and blonde These trait are mentioned standalone and not juxtaposed against other hypothetical trait which lead me to believe they are mentioned because the speaker also identifies with these trait This is further supported when looking at the greater lyrical context of the whole album in Text Book the narrator mention that their past self used to be blonde amp in Arcadia the narrator characterizes herself a 5 8 which is generally understood to be tall for a woman All of these thing rolled together in the context of the other lyric in the verse combined with the narrator calling herself Mommy in the bridge indicate to me that the narrator is speaking to either 1 the memory of the narrator s child now grown up 2 the memory of the narrator s child now passed away 3 the memory of another child the narrator wa close with in a motherly capacity 4 the memory of the narrator s past self whether that be their literal child that passed away a a child or the child of someone now grown up that they personally identified with or had some kind of relationship or connection to Finally the little blonde ghost is named by the narrator a Angelina I find it interesting that the name Angelina is derived from the word angel which the narrator also identifies themselves with in the song Arcadia and Black Bathing Suit Is this name the child s literal name or is it symbolic If it s symbolic is the identification of the child with angel a reference to a deceased spirit popular connotation or a reference to an innocent pure state another popular meaning also the way it is used in Arcadia and Black Bathing Suit Those who interpret the song to be about the narrator speaking to the memory of their child self or their inner child would probably say the name Angelina to be the narrator s name or a substitute for the narrator s name In the context of the greater album the author Lana Del Rey change her sister s name Caroline to Carolina in the title of the biographical song Sweet Carolina Angelina is lexically and visually similar to the name Elizabeth which we know to be the real name of the author of the song But then why is the child s name Angelina only introduced in the final verse specifically after the bridge where the narrator identifies herself a Mommy If the narrator is trying to convey that she herself is Angelina grown up my personal feeling is that it would make more sense to call out her name earlier on near the beginning of the song I believe that the name reveal at the end of the song is therefore done for dramatic effect for emphasis It s meant to specifically draw attention back to the implicit connection between the child with angelic quality either their pure or deceased nature a suggested by the name Angelina itself Given the context of everything else I feel like I m sadly inclined to believe it make more sense that the dramatic effect of revealing the ghost s name a Angelina at the end of the song serf to suggest the deceased nature of the subject of the song rather than being the literal name of a concrete person or the name of the narrator herself a a child In the meta context of the full album Lana Del Rey ha referenced a complicated relationship with motherhood due to her relationship with her mother We know that the narrator in the album had a strained relationship with their mother and by extension motherhood The narrator wa abused by their mother Wildflower Wildfire The narrator express that they want to symbolically rectify or karmically right their mother s wrong by they themselves living in a different more genuine more compassionate way Text Book Black Bathing Suit The narrator reference her dislike of the season Spring in the title track Blue Banisters Is this due to Mother s Day being in the spring or is it potentially due to some connection to Cherry Blossom a cherry blossom are symbolic of spring If this aversion to Spring is connected to something within Cherry Blossom to me it would also logically be connected to the narrator s identification with the title Mommy In summary based on my lyrical analysis and the greater context of the whole album the track Cherry Blossom is most likely a song about a narrator speaking to either 1 the ghost of their child who ha passed away grieving about the hypothetical life the child will miss the grief compounded by the narrator s implied difficult relationship with their own mother 2 the ghost of their former self the narrator mourning the loss of their own childhood due to their volatile relationship with their mother,Literary analysis of Cherry Blossom,I apologize really incoherent I wanted present evidence pointing I feel likely interpretation song Cherry Blossom

lanadelrey,True,False,"I started listening to some Lana Del Rey albums after reading that there was a large overlap between Queens of the Stone Age and Lana Del Rey fans. I asked one of my classmates that I know is a huge fan of hers about which albums to start with, and she recommended Norman :( Rockwell, Ultraviolence, and Blue Banisters. I am making this post to ask about which albums I should listen to next based on my thoughts on these albums. Now, for my thoughts on these albums: Norman Rockwell: I liked this album, but there are major things I dislike about it as well. I need to first state that there were no ‚Äúweak‚Äù tracks on this album, and that I did enjoy it quite a bit. It is my introduction to Lana Del Rey, and I was impressed. That said, I was put off by a few things. The album is already pretty long (which I am seeing is a trend with her albums), and there were many times where I checked what the next song was to be greeted with 5-30 seconds of apparent dead silence. There was also little variety between a lot of the songs, which made the album a little uneventful. My final gripe is the high amount of cursing on the album. For some reason, I am usually put off by heavy cursing in music, and the sheer amount of loud and obvious curse words made me uncomfortable while listening to otherwise soothing music. My favorite songs upon first listen were Mariners Apartment Complex, Venice Btch, Bartender, and happiness is a butterfly. Ultraviolence was the second album I listened to, and is the best one so far. Once I reached Shades of Cool, I was blown away. The songs were catchy and seemed to have a much more ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù sound. There were no boring or bad songs on the album, and there was enough variety through the heavy reverb to keep me interested. While I know there was still cursing, it was less present in this album, and I was glad for it (except for track 9). My favorite songs on this album were Shades of Cool, Cruel World, Brooklyn Baby, Pretty When You Cry, and West Coast. Afterwards, I listened to Blue Banisters, which I was not particularly fond of. The first half of the album seemed sad and boring, but it thankfully picked up by Violets for Roses. Once again, cursing was less present as in NFR!, and it made for easier listening. There was more variety by side 2, and I thought the songs were better overall. Due to the lenh of the album, it would probably be better more of the songs on side 1 were cut. My favorite songs on this album were Dealer, Violets for Roses, and Nectar of the Gods. So, what should I listen to next?

lanadelrey,True,False,"Since Born to Die‚Äôs release, it has charted on the Billboard Top 200 for nearly a decade. I believe it‚Äôs 1 of only 3 albums by women (Carole King‚Äôs Tapestry and Adele‚Äôs 21) to break this record Besides the music and Lana Del Rey being great, I wonder if it would have broken this record if Lana didn‚Äôt release new albums so often? An artist‚Äôs debut record spending more time on the Billboard Top 200 than pretty much every other female artist‚Äôs records is a pretty unique feat to accomplish. Another unique feat to Lana is that instead of traditionally releasing albums every 3-4 years like other artists, she releases almost every year. When an artist releases a new album, it increases the chances of the listener playing their back-catalog of music. Thus, the more Lana releases, the more play time BTD gains. In theory, Lana could record a terrible record, but she would still come out ahead after releasing it. Even if the listener disliked the record, it would remind them about the artist‚Äôs catalog of other music and possibly redirect them into playing their older work. From a business perspective, this actually gives Lana SO MUCH MORE freedom as an artist, because this same principal applies to releasing a record that has less appeal with the general public, but is still true to her art. For instance, Honeymoon is her least-known record, yet it‚Äôs also a cult classic in the fandom. The ones who didn‚Äôt like Honeymoon upon its release probably played something that they knew they enjoyed like BTD, subsequently giving Lana the same number of streams she otherwise would have gotten if Honeymoon had been a hit. In a way, BTD existing makes up for the potential losses of an album flopping. It gives Lana the freedom to release more indie albums that appeal to niche audiences, while also benefiting from the exposure BTD gains from such releases. A few months back, I posted  on why Lana‚Äôs team doesn‚Äôt promote and why her albums may (purposely) leak. Well, if her teams use her later albums as a vehicle to redirect most people to re-listen to BTD, wouldn‚Äôt it make sense for them to not promote the records? Why cast a shadow onto an iconic era that so much time, energy, and creativity was invested into? Upon her album releases, her team knows it doesn‚Äôt matter who it‚Äôs trying to appeal to, because the true fans will still listen, and many others may be prompted to give BTD a re-listen. What do you guys think? I don‚Äôt think any of this was pre-calculated for Lana, but in the future this may be a viable strategy for other artists: release a mass-appeal album to keep paying the bills, so that you can create whatever you want after that. On more thing I‚Äôll add to this theory is that Lana releasing Mariners Apartment Complex and Venice Bitch an entire year before the album raised a lot of questions and confused fans‚Ä¶ Well, 2018 was one of the only years she didn‚Äôt release an album, and BTD was kind of charting low then ;)",A theory on why Born to Die is so successful and why it‚Äôs allowed Lana to make newer music with less appeal,t5_2tegk,1639847726,1.0,taylrbrwr,0,sinc born to die s releas it ha chart on the billboard top 200 for nearli a decad i believ it s 1 of onli 3 album by women carol king s tapestri and adel s

public but is still true to her art for instanc honeymoon is her least known record yet it s also a cult classic in the fandom the one who didn t like honeymoon upon it releas probabl play someth that

pay the bill so that you can creat whatev you want after that on more thing i ll add to thi theori is that lana releas marin apart complex and venic bitch an entir year befor the album rais a lot of question and confus fan well 2018 wa one of the onli year she didn t releas an album and btd wa kind of chart low then,a theori on whi born to die is so success and whi it s allow lana to make newer music with less appeal,Since Born to Die s release it ha charted on the Billboard Top 200 for nearly a decade I believe it s 1 of only 3 album by woman Carole King s Tapestry and Adele s 21 to break this record Besides the music and Lana Del Rey being great I wonder if it would have broken this record if Lana didn t release new album so often An artist s debut record spending more time on the Billboard Top 200 than pretty much every other female artist s record is a pretty unique feat to accomplish Another unique feat to Lana is that instead of traditionally releasing album every 3 4 year like other artist she release almost every year When an artist release a new album it increase the chance of the listener playing their back catalog of music Thus the more Lana release the more play time BTD gain In theory Lana could record a terrible record but she would still come out ahead after releasing it Even if the listener disliked the record it would remind them about the artist s catalog of other music and possibly redirect them into playing their older work From a business perspective this actually give Lana SO MUCH MORE freedom a an artist because this same principal applies to releasing a record that ha le appeal with the general public but is still true to her art For instance Honeymoon is her least known record yet it s also a cult classic in the fandom The one who didn t like Honeymoon upon it release probably played something that they knew they enjoyed like BTD subsequently giving Lana the same number of stream she otherwise would have gotten if Honeymoon had been a hit In a way BTD existing make up for the potential loss of an album flopping It give Lana the freedom to release more indie album that appeal to niche audience while also benefiting from the exposure BTD gain from such release A few month back I posted on why Lana s team doesn t promote and why her album may purposely leak Well if her team use her later album a a vehicle to redirect most people to re listen to BTD wouldn t it make sense for them to not promote the record Why cast a shadow onto an iconic era that so much time energy and creativity wa invested into Upon her album release her team know it doesn t matter who it s trying to appeal to because the true fan will still listen and many others may be prompted to give BTD a re listen What do you guy think I don t think any of this wa pre calculated for Lana but in the future this may be a viable strategy for other artist release a mass appeal album to keep paying the bill so that you can create whatever you want after that On more thing I ll add to this theory is that Lana releasing Mariners Apartment Complex and Venice Bitch an entire year before the album raised a lot of question and confused fan Well 2018 wa one of the only year she didn t release an album and BTD wa kind of charting low then,A theory on why Born to Die is so successful and why it s allowed Lana to make newer music with le appeal,Since Born Die release charted Billboard Top 200 nearly decade I believe 1 3 album woman Carole King Tapestry Adele 21 break record Besides music Lana Del Rey great I wonder broken record Lana release new album An artist debut record spending time Billboard Top 200 pretty female artist record pretty unique feat accomplish Another unique feat Lana instead traditionally releasing album 3 4 year artist

lanadelrey,True,False,"So I was watching the Fuck it, I love you / The Greatest music video and I just want to appreciate how this album came out of absolutely nowhere to now stand tall as her Magnum Opus. I remember vividly in 2018 when MAC released, that I thought Lana had lost her magic. Lust For Life was the least favorite album I had heard from her, and even though there was some songs I liked, most of them felt gimmicky - i.e: let's plant something trap just because it's popular. Oh and let's bring on about 12 million producers as well. It'll work great (sorry for the editorial comment) I thought maybe my ride with Lana had come to a close, but no. Norman Fucking Rockwell was that album. It accompagnied me through the toughest times, and yet, it felt like a breeze because Lana's portrait of the southern California sun-dripped beaches, runned down bars and rocky relationships. I still can't believe this is a real album. The cohesiveness is just unmatched. From the opener to the closer, the narrative is threaded in a masterful way; at one point toying with the slower balads, then coming back with the strong guitars riffs and synthethizers just to end up with a deeply personnal song. I might be wrong, but I don't think we'll ever get something like that ever from Lana. It doesn't mean all her other albums aren't going to be good (Blue Banisters is right behind Honeymoon and NFR in my top 3) but I'd be very pleasantly surprised at the end of Lana's career that this album was surpassed, either lyrically or sonically. She even said it herself in a previous interview: she made NFR with the intention of this being her ""best work"". Anyways. What was your reaction to NFR? Was it bad? Was it total adoration? I want to know Do you think Lana will ever put out an album as lauded as this?

I didn‚Äôt listen to BTD for a long time.. then I got into a relationship with someone my own age and one day on the train I decided I wanted to listen to it again.

lanadelrey,True,False,"Day 52: Carmen Analysis: Carmen paints a portrait of the tragically beautiful ‚Äî the decrepitude that lies in the underbelly of the divine. It is haunting, it is harrowing, it is blinding. Teen movies that have long taken place in mainstream media have often portrayed adolescence in an archetypical fashion, with surface level depictions and neat resolutions. Indie darlings like Thirteen (2003) and Kids (1995) have attempted to dive further into the complexities of adolescence that are particularly framed within very real life circumstances in which children find themselves having to grow up much faster than they ought to. Carmen portrays the life of one such girl, who at the age of 17 has already found herself engaging in illicit activities like drinking, drug use, and what is implied to be sex work. She is a glamorous figure adored by many, but states herself that no one should ever be in her position. She is clearly cognisant of how destructive her life is, and is eager to urge caution to those who wish to pursue a similar lifestyle. Lana takes time in the bridge to emphasise how Carmen is merely still a child: ‚ÄúBaby‚Äôs all dressed up with nowhere to go, that‚Äôs the little story of the girl you know. Relying on the kindness of strangers.‚Äù These lines are used to convey the na√Øvet√© and innocence of a child, and are used to directly juxtapose the next set of lines in the chorus: ‚ÄúTying cherry knots, smiling, doing party favors. Put your red dress on, put your lipstick on. Sing your song, song, now the camera's on. And you're alive again.‚Äù Carmen hides behind the facade of a confident and sexual woman, which becomes all the more disturbing after reading the first half of the bridge. It should also be mentioned how Lana quotes the infamous line from a Streetcar Named Desire: ""Whoever you are -- I have always depended on the kindness of strangers."" I could dive further into an analysis of Blanche DuBois here, but Sparknotes already has it covered pretty solidly lol. Thoughts: God I love this song. Easily in the top 3 of Born to Die. It truly showcases some of Lana‚Äôs best writing. Through my analysis of the lyrics I couldn‚Äôt help but think of the 'toddler to train wreck' pipeline, and how many of our millennial female icons particularly seem to have been vulnerable to falling into this trap. Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan, Amanda Bynes etc. There‚Äôs so much to be explored here: ‚ÄúYou don't want to get this way / Famous and dumb at an early age‚Äù ‚ÄúYou don't want to get this way / Street walk at night and a star by day‚Äù There are so many psychological consequences of childhood stardom that only seem to being discussed and studied more seriously now. It‚Äôs a weird form of exploitative child labour that doesn‚Äôt garner the concern it deserves, due to the manufactured elite status associated with it. But that‚Äôs a whole other topic to fall into. Getting back to topic, even though I prefer the official released version, I nevertheless can‚Äôt ignore how impactful the demo version is. The acapella harmonies and echoing effects are all the more haunting and for some reason make me think of a young woman singing alone in a dark alleyway.

lanadelrey,True,False,"Day 51: Black Bathing Suit Analysis: I‚Äôm finding it increasingly difficult to adhere to my own rules of not speculating on Lana‚Äôs personal life whenever it comes to analysing her lyrics. But with Blue Banisters it‚Äôs almost impossible to ignore the very personal nature of the lyrical content, particularly in this track. The hyper-realistic narrative that she paints of the pandemic. The depiction of her broken relationship with her mother (that continues to be an interwoven theme in this record). And the cheeky and almost fuck you attitude in the outro of the song that clearly lashes out against her critics. So once again, I'm breaking own rules. Whoops. During the early days of the pandemic, arguably every single person on the planet endured (what every fucking ad likes to remind you of) unprecedent circumstances. Quarantine showcased some of our best and worst attributes. It held such a massive impact on our mental health. And depending on our situations, we either grew closer to some people, or our relationships completely fell apart. Lana opens with the feelings of uncertainty we held over what, at that time, almost seemed apocalyptic. ‚ÄúIf this is the end, I want a boyfriend‚Äù touches on these fears, as well as the desperation of sudden loneliness. So many of us seek companionship in our lives, and it‚Äôs understandable that in the most uncertain of times, we simply crave the comfort of a loved one to get us by. Lana then touches on weight gain, something that so many of us experienced during lockdown (I can personally relate oof). I love that the essence of Lana‚Äôs self is contained in this black bathing suit for the purposes of this track. Not only is it (literally) the only thing she fits into following weight gain, I think it also represents her most inner thoughts and desires. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know me any better than they do, baby.‚Äù She is a private and closed off person. The only time you‚Äôll ever truly understand her is in your fantasies: ‚ÄúThe only time you‚Äôll ever see me is in your dreams, in my black bathing suit.‚Äù The second verse alludes to Lana‚Äôs broken ties with her mother. The mention of ‚Äúkarmic lineage‚Äù is fascinating ‚Äì it‚Äôs as if she feels like she was destined to be troubled in one way or another. By revealing this, she coyly asks a future partner if that‚Äôs something they might be able to accept. It‚Äôs fucking tough allowing yourself to fall in love when you‚Äôre so scared of being rejected as soon as your more personal facets are revealed. Leading into the second chorus, Lana once again ties multitudes of meaning in the black bathing suit: ‚ÄúI wish you could see to my soul through this black bathing suit.‚Äù The outro almost takes a 180. No longer is she apologising for her past or her complicated life. Instead, she‚Äôs seething and almost haughty. Fuck all of you for all the shit you‚Äôve said about me. It‚Äôs about reclaiming all the criticism thrown her way. She couldn‚Äôt give a fuck. She knows that the only opinions she cares about are those within her inner circle. Also, she‚Äôs still making money, because people will forever run their mouths about her. So fuck them, lol. Thoughts: This song took me a while to get into. To be completely honest this entire album took me several listens to finally appreciate it. I think it‚Äôs because there‚Äôs so much Lizzy in this entire record. It‚Äôs messier, less cohesive, and musically it‚Äôs all unrefined. Once you‚Äôre able to finally get into that particular headspace, though, this album is a bona fide satisfactory joy. Songs like Noir and Scarface are so controversial in Lana‚Äôs discography, and yet they remain so intriguing to us. Hearing Lana deliberately sing out of key to almost shout, is carefully crafted to exude particular moods, and BBS is no different. (Also, props for the nod to Video Games).

lanadelrey,True,False,"First of all, I think what traumatized her in early childhood was discovering about death. Lana has made clear that the fear of death and higher existential pondering has driven at least some of her early life turmoil and depression. This + her relationship with Patty being strained has led her to become a rebellious teenager. Around 15 years old she is sent to boarding school (because of alcohol) and there she bonds with a teacher who introduces her to music and literature. As we know, there's speculation that something more than a friendship was between them, especially since she refers to older men and Lolita concepts a lot in her music. Is likely that maybe, she saw her younger self in the character of Lolita? After boarding school, she moves to New York where she learns guitar and in the meantime she works as a waitress. There I believe she met who we knows as the infamous Jim. I think Jim could be the leader of some alcohol recovering cults and her being young and in a vulnerable state of mind (probably) found in Jim a role model and a saviour. However as we know, Jim was probably abusive. While being in mysterious 'Jim' cult (who btw besides being probably older than her, he was also heavily into heavy metal and rock subculture) Lizzy starts diving into songwriting. She also starts studying theology because she's obsessed about knowing what God knows (cit). Her early 20s are about her relationship with Jim and her ""wild New York phase"". I think she got into motorcycles, wanderlust and ""free love"". In her music, she mentioned being often disappointed or hurt in her youth and that she was on the verge of marrying or getting married in Vegas. I believe she at one point engaged with Jim and that they had to marry, but he was frisky and in the end abandoned her. This, combined with her musical career not being successful led Lizzy to fresh start and become Lana, move to London and start working on Born to Die.

lanadelrey,True,False,"Some questions you can answer if you want: What are your favorite and least favorite songs? Do you think the album aged/will age well? What is your favorite aspect of it? What do you think could be better? I have a weird relationship with this album. I listen to it the least out of all her work. However, there are times when I just wanna get stoned and lay under the sun, and this is the absolute perfect album to do it with. On days like that, I could easily consider this my favorite project from Lana. I think it‚Äôs one of her most cohesive projects. Based on production only, I think it is by a long shot. It opens with Honeymoon, a song I‚Äôve never once found myself listening to on its own. I really enjoy it though. It‚Äôs a beautiful introduction that perfectly sets the slow moving, meandering, hazy tone of the record. Music To Watch Boys To further continues this. Terrance is a nice jazzy record. God Knows I Tried is a standout for me. It might be my favorite song on this album. Although it has such simple production and lyrics, you feel it in your bones. High By The Beach, Freak, and Art Deco feel like a nice trio and centerpiece to the album. Freak is another stand out for me, the chorus just makes you wanna lean back and sway right along with her. Burnt Norton is a beautiful poem, I don‚Äôt mind that she included it as an interlude. The only song I don‚Äôt absolutely love out of the final six is 24, but I still don‚Äôt skip it. The rest are all incredible, and I love her cover of Don‚Äôt Let Me Be Misunderstood. I know everyone collectively agrees that her recent work since Norman has been on another level lyrically, which I think is true, but it‚Äôs hard to deny that the skill hasn‚Äôt always been there. She has always had an incredible way with words, it just wasn‚Äôt quite as mature yet. This record has beautiful writing. ‚ÄúSometimes I wake up in the morning to red, blue, and yellow lights/On Monday they destroyed me, but by Friday I'm revived/Put on that hotel California, wear my blinders in the rain/I've got nothing much to live for, ever since I found my fame‚Äù I think this her least ‚Äúaccessible‚Äù album. I don‚Äôt mean that in a negative way at all, but I‚Äôm a huge fan and on first listen this album was not my favorite. It is very slow, and has this wandering quality where it never feels like it finds where it‚Äôs going. It feels like stumbling through smoke, completely lost. Every song evokes this, and it‚Äôs incredibly clear through the whole thing. Just as Ultraviolence created a whole sonic world, this one made a completely different one. I never really listen to any of these songs individually. None of them sound like ‚Äúsingles‚Äù to me. I don‚Äôt listen to the album often at all, so every time I do it blows me away a little more. In my opinion this album is aging beautifully and will only continue doing so. The lyrics are timeless and the production is so subtle and clean. The beauty of Honeymoon is in its subtlety, and at least for me, it took time to fully appreciate it.

Do you think the album aged will age well What is your favorite aspect of it What do you think could be better I have a weird relationship with this album I listen to it the least out of all her work However there are time when I just wanna get stoned and lay under the sun and this is the absolute perfect album to do it with On day like that I could easily consider this my favorite project from Lana I think it s one of her most cohesive project Based on production only I think it is by a long shot It open with Honeymoon a song I ve never once found myself listening to on it own I really enjoy it though It s a beautiful introduction that perfectly set the slow moving meandering hazy tone of the record Music To Watch Boys To further continues this Terrance is a nice jazzy record God Knows I Tried is a standout for me It might be my favorite song on this album Although it ha such simple production and lyric you feel it in your bone High By The Beach Freak and Art Deco feel like a nice trio and centerpiece to the album Freak is another stand out for me the chorus just make you wanna lean back and sway right along with her Burnt Norton is a beautiful poem I don t mind that she included it a an interlude The only song I don t absolutely love out of the final six is 24 but I still don t skip it The rest are all incredible and I love her cover of Don t Let Me Be Misunderstood I know everyone collectively agrees that her recent work since Norman ha been on another level lyrically which I think is true but it s hard to deny that the skill hasn t always been there She ha always had an incredible way with word it just wasn t quite a mature yet This record ha beautiful writing Sometimes I wake up in the morning to red blue and yellow light On Monday they destroyed me but by Friday I m revived Put on that hotel California wear my blinder in the rain I ve got nothing much to live for ever since I found my fame I think this her least accessible album I don t mean that in a negative way at all but I m a huge fan and on first listen this album wa not my favorite It is very slow and ha this wandering quality where it never feel like it find where it s going It feel like stumbling through smoke completely lost Every song evokes this and it s incredibly clear through the whole thing Just a Ultraviolence created a whole sonic world this one made a completely different one I never really listen to any of these song individually None of them sound like single to me I don t listen to the album often at all so every time I do it blow me away a little more In

lanadelrey,True,False,"Here we are, I‚Äôm pretty sure I could write a full lenh novel about this album, but I‚Äôll try to keep it concise. Some questions you can answer if you want: What are your favorite and least favorite songs? Do you think the album aged/will age well? What is your favorite aspect of it? What do you think could be better? I‚Äôm not even sure where to start with this one. This record to me sounds like the middle of July when it‚Äôs so hot outside that it‚Äôs almost unbearable, getting high under the sun. When Cruel World starts, it immediately transports me there. That guitar sounds hazy, feels like exhaling smoke as you lean your head back towards the white sun. Cruel World is my favorite of her openers. Although it is lyrically a little repetitive, it doesn‚Äôt matter. You immediately know exactly where this album is about to take you, and that‚Äôs all I can ask of a first track. It‚Äôs the perfect introduction to the psychosexual drama and twisted journey that the unreliable narrator is about to take you on. The title track. I‚Äôll never forget the first time I heard it. I didn‚Äôt cry, I wouldn‚Äôt even say it made me sad. It was just unbelievably heavy. This song is a complete acceptance that you are addicted to something terrible for you. Whether you read it like she‚Äôs talking about alcohol or a man, that statement holds true. It sounds like someone who‚Äôs been through so much in their life and they simply have no more fight left. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm your jazz singer, your my cult leader, I love you forever‚Äù Shades of Cool is a great song, just doesn‚Äôt do that much for me melodically, definitely not a skip though. Brooklyn Baby is great, it‚Äôs much lighter than the first three which was necessary. West Coast is a fucking incredible song. No matter your opinions on Lana or her music, I don‚Äôt think anybody could listen to this and deny that it is a great song. Pure artistry. The transition into the chorus sounds like actual drugs. This song is top tier and I still think it‚Äôs one of the best of her career. Sad Girl is an interesting one. Lyrically it does seem basic on the surface ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a sad girl, I‚Äôm a bad girl‚Äù but with the context of the rest of the song and the album, ‚Äúsad‚Äù definitely means ‚Äúpathetic‚Äù. She‚Äôs basically calling herself pathetic for letting this happen. Pretty when you cry is impressive on its own, not to mention the fact it was improvised in one take. There‚Äôs a desperation/sadness in her vocals that is unparalleled. Money Power Glory is another standout track for me. ‚ÄúYou talk lots about God, Freedom comes from the call, But that's not what this bitch wants, Not what I want at all‚Äù An interesting combination of feeling like the baddest bitch alive yet still being depressed. Her wailing in the chorus is addicting. Fucked My Way To The Top continues this. Old Money is one of the saddest songs of her career, and another standout on this album. The Other Woman is a fine cover, not my favorite but I don‚Äôt hate that it was included. Black Beauty is another stand out. Guns and Roses is fine, I don‚Äôt hate it or love it, not a skip. Florida Kilos is definitely the ‚Äúpoppiest‚Äù song on the album. I don‚Äôt dislike it, but it doesn‚Äôt deserve the closing spot at all. That brings me to my least favorite aspect of the album. It feels like it fizzles out towards the end, doesn‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs concluded. In my opinion, Black Beauty and Old Money should‚Äôve been the last two tracks. Florida Kilos (or The Other Woman, depending on the version) does not do it justice. I wouldn‚Äôt cut FK, but I would‚Äôve moved it up somewhere around Brooklyn Baby. My favorite aspect of the album is the cohesion. Her and her producers built a sonic world and landscape that this album lives in. None of the songs sound the same, but they all just sound like they belong together. About how this album will age, I‚Äôm not exactly sure. I know that personally I will always enjoy this album, and I do believe that the production is timeless. Lyrically there are risks taken that many people didn‚Äôt appreciate at the time it was released, and I can‚Äôt see that getting better with the years.

lanadelrey,True,False,"I debated posting a discussion for this because it isn‚Äôt a full lenh body of work, but I decided to anyway. I honestly think it‚Äôs a very strong project that shouldn‚Äôt be tacked on the end of Born to Die. It‚Äôs very dense lyrically and shows us a lot about what her inspirations are. Some questions I started with last time, you can answer them or just say whatever comes to mind: What are your favorite and least favorite songs? Do you think the album aged/will age well? What is your favorite aspect of it? What do you think could be better? I‚Äôm gonna start out with a (maybe?) controversial opinion. I think this is a stronger project than Born To Die. Lyrically it‚Äôs miles ahead, and I find the production more enjoyable. Ride is not my favorite, but it is a very strong opener. This is a classic Lana song. ‚ÄúI hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast/I am alone at midnight/Been tryin' hard not to get in trouble, but I I've got a war in my mind/I just ride‚Äù is the type of lyrics Lana became known for as an artist, and I think this song tied it all together with a nice little bow around it. American is an interesting song. I think this is the point in the record when it becomes clear the lyrical content is not to be taken literally or too seriously. Nobody is singing ‚Äúbe young, be dope, be proud like an American‚Äù without some sarcasm. And I think it comes across nicely. I absolutely love the melody of this song, in Ride she told us about the freedom, and in this song you can feel it. Cola, known for the iconic opening line. Continues with the hyperbolic lyrics. This is one of my three favorites on the record. This is a song written from the perspective of someone who‚Äôs lost all morals, and although I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs her, I think it‚Äôs a part in all of us. ‚ÄúDrugs, suck it up, like vanilla icies/Don't treat me rough, treat me really niceys/Decorate my neck, diamantes ices‚Äù the way she sings this part and the melody is one of the most addicting parts of any song I‚Äôve ever heard lmao Body Electric is another one of my favorites. ‚ÄúElvis is my daddy, Marilyn's my mother/Jesus is my bestest friend‚Äù ‚ÄúWhitman is my daddy, Monaco‚Äôs my mother/Diamonds are my bestest friend‚Äù these lines basically explain the inspiration for this record. Poetry with a backdrop of sex, drugs, and death. There‚Äôs something about it that is almost unsettling, I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs the key or the melody, but it works perfectly. This song sounds like accepting a complete loss of innocence. The change from ‚ÄúMary prays the rosary for my broken mind‚Äù to ‚ÄúMary swayin' softly, to her hearts delight‚Äù is how she explicitly states this. Blue Velvet is for sure my least favorite, I don‚Äôt have much to say about it. Gods and Monsters, how do I even start with this one. This is absolutely my favorite and in my opinion the strongest song on here. Some of the most complex lyrics she‚Äôs ever written. It carries on the theme of body electric, explicitly stating ‚Äúinnocence lost‚Äù multiple times. This song sounds hopeless, but also free, like it‚Äôs written from the perspective of someone who‚Äôs lost everything. I think every line of this song deserves to be analyzed, but I‚Äôve already written way too much. ‚ÄúLife imitates art‚Äù seems to be the mission statement for this EP. The last few songs are good, but I never listen to them if I‚Äôm not listening to the entire project. Overall I think this album will age like fine wine. Although I don‚Äôt think many people will discover it decades later, I think for her dedicated fans this one will be highly appreciated. It‚Äôs much less accessible than Born To Die, most of the songs need time to sit with and be processed, where BTD can be digested with just a couple listens. Although it‚Äôs in a much different fashion, Paradise is where we started to see her skills in writing intricate melodies and lyrics that are present throughout the rest of her career. Her writing is definitely my favorite aspect.

Just random thoughts or things you notice that are interesting but don‚Äôt know where to share. Would anybody else like to discuss them in depth?

What is your favorite aspect of it? What do you think could be better? To start, my favorite songs are the title track, Radio, and Carmen. My least favorite is Diet Mountain Dew. To be completely honest, this album already sounds dated to me. I think out of all of her albums, this one won‚Äôt stand the test of time as well as any of her others. My favorite aspect of this album is that every single song sounds like it should be the standout. If any of the songs were released as singles, you wouldn‚Äôt think twice. I also love some of the wordplay she does on this record.

lanadelrey,True,False,"This is the only place that will appreciate this story. Backstory tangent‚Ä¶ cringe backstory, but it gets better I‚Äôm a Lana fan I promise. I was out for a run when Blue Banisters dropped and got a Spotify notification so I gave it a listen‚Ä¶ it was not my favorite. I forced myself to listen to the entire album during the run because I was so confused by it. I‚Äôve always considered myself a fan of hers, but haven‚Äôt really listened to her entire albums since BTD/Paradise‚Ä¶ just singles and remixes here and there. Listening to BB for the first time I was like ‚ÄúWho is this? What genre is this? Huh???‚Äù As of a month ago the only song I knew from NFR was Doin‚Äô Time and in SoCal that song plays at bars so I knew her cover of it. Now mind you, I needed to understand how Lana got to BB and when I apparently missed the boat. So since October I‚Äôve been only listening to her albums at night, at the gym and while gaming. So I started with BTD. Yes. IMHO every is a song is an absolute bass-filled banger. The only song I don‚Äôt know full lyrics to is This is what makes us girls, and it‚Äôs probably because I‚Äôm a dude üëãüèæ Paradise. I knew verbatim. Paradise Edition album cover is palm tree perfection. Then Ultraviolenceeeeeeeeeee. Ultraviolenceeeeeee. My third or fourth time ever listening to that entire masterpiece start to finished was last month West Coast is amazing. Really good album. My very first time listening to Honeymoon, ever, was last month. I remember when High By The Beach came out because of the rocket launcher in the video, but for some reason I didn‚Äôt listen to the Honeymoon album. Honeymoon is incredible. I love singing the ‚ÄúDaAArRk Blueeee‚Äù. High By The Beach. Salvatore. Blackest Day. My throat is sore from singing the ‚ÄúHallelujah‚Äù in Religion. My neighbors hate me for attempting the ‚ÄúI NEEEEED your love‚Äù every damn morning. Oh yea 24! After lurking on this Reddit for a bit, I think‚Äî people think‚Äî people don‚Äôt like that album? I don‚Äôt buy it. Honeymoon is so bomb. It makes me feel like I‚Äôm in a James Bond movie driving an Aston Martin. Lust üëèüèæ For üëèüèæ Life üëèüèæ Groupie Love. Cherry. Summer Bummer. Rap lyrics. Beats. Album Cover. Yes. Now here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm divided. First time ever hearing NFR was recently. To me, this is the start of another Lana? I do like the song NFR‚Äôs ‚ÄúBLUuu-u-u-u-UUE‚Äù Mariners Apartment is always a skip. Venice grew on me. F-it ily is growing on me. California. Cinnamon. The Next Best. All Cool. This album is.. ok to me I certainly don‚Äôt play it in my car. Cool for walks. I can not make it through Chemtrails. I‚Äôm sorry. I can‚Äôt get through white dress. I still haven‚Äôt given this album a full listen. I‚Äôll keep trying. I just don‚Äôt understand it. Chemtrails has me completely lost sonically, visually and artistically. The story comes full circle now and I understand where Blue Banisters came from. I do like it more than Chemtrails for sure. BB. Black Bathing Suit. Living Legend. Cherry Blossom. I don‚Äôt sing along to it, but I know the songs. So I guess my takeaway is, the after NFRs sound is very intriguing to me. Especially seeing online that it‚Äôs ‚Äúher best?‚Äù I am so confused, but really curious about her next album.

I continue on to the Blue Banisters track and what do you know, also very good So I start digging and holy flying fuck, what is this sorcery?

Metallica,True,False,"Hello all. Die hard Metallica fan here. One of my favorite things to do is listen to old live recordings of Metallica through the years. I really enjoy hearing the band play rare/ deep cuts in the early years as well as picking out the slight differences in performances between years. I even bought a subscription to nugs.net for a year or so bc they have a ton of soundboard recordings of old Metallica shows split up by the year they were played. As far as I recall, every year since 1982 was represented, except for one: 1990. My question really boils down to why there are no soundboard recordings (official recordings not fan or bootleg recordings) from that year? Some might wonder why I even care, but really the 1990 shows were unique. Metallica did a short European tour that year and was basically an extension of the justice tour. However, said shows featured a killer medley of no remorse mixed with the four horsemen, as well as the first performances of the shortest straw. The medley only made one other appearance (day on the green 1991) and although the shortest straw would be taken on tour in 1992, James‚Äô voice definitely isn‚Äôt wasn‚Äôt good as it was in 1990 (you can really hear the difference in the verses).

Metallica,True,False,"I've been off work for a month and starting to get bored, so I put together some information related to my Metallica history. Maybe it's boring, maybe you'll find it interesting.  I've seen Metallica at least 17 times. There might be one or two I missed.  My first Metallica show was July 16th 1988 (Monsters of Rock)  I've seen them in 5 different decades.  All shows I've been to are in California.  I was 16 the first time I saw them and 49 the last time I saw them.  I've witnessed two song debuts. St. Anger and Fixxxer  I've heard 67 songs live in concert.  Notable shows include: July 16th 1988, Sep 16th 1989, Sept 24th 1992, May 21st 2003, Nov 13th 2005, Feb 6th 2016, and Dec 17th/19th 2021.  July 16th 1988 is notable because it was my first Metallica show and it was a stadium tour with 4 other bands. Van Halen, Scorpions, Dokken and Kingdom Come.  Sept 16th 1989 is notable because they were at their peak and the show was by far the best one I've seen Jason had a bottle thrown at him while playing his bass solo. It hit his bass and he got super pissed and asked the person who threw the bottle to come on stage so he could kick his ass lol. Also, they actually asked the audience which song we wanted to hear and Damage Inc. was selected. It's the only time I've ever heard Damage Inc. live.  Sept 24th 1992 is notable because John Marshall played guitar for James on every song but Enter Sandman. They played 18 songs that day. It was also a Stadium tour with GnR. Metallica opened that day.  May 21st 2003 is notable because it was 4 free shows for club members only. I got to see night 3 of 4. It was also the debut of St. Anger.  Nov 13th 2005 is notable because Metallica opened for The Rolling Stones. Metallica played Orion.  Feb 15th is notable because it was the ""Too heavy for halftime/The night before"" the superbowl show.  Dec 17th/19th 2021 is notable because it was the 40th anniversary shows and the debut of Fixxxer. I also got to hear Orion in its entirety for the first time.

Metallica,True,False,"I always deemed The Call Of Ktulu as my least favorite instrumental of Metallica's, due to it being repetitive and not standing out as much, but I couldn't have ever been more wrong in my 3 years of listening. I've heard a lot of talk about Cliff Burton's amazing bass playing, and I've heard it clearly on Anesthesia and Orion, but I have quite a hard time hearing the bass in all of Cliff's other studio work. I don't think it's uncommon knowledge that Metallica tends to bury their bass in mixing so I don't think not hearing the bass very audibly is uncommon. Then I got ^high. I don't smoke often, that's why this is signifcant I was listening to One and started to notice that I was able to hear Jason's bass a bit. ""Wait... what the fuck?"" I thought to myself. As I mentioned earlier, it's quite hard for me to hear bass playing, but seemingly, in the album where the bass is the most hidden, I was able to hear it. I'm positive that smoking made it easier for me to home in on the bass. I had a fun idea to jump deeper into the heaviness of bass by listening to Orion. I was already pretty familiar with Orion's bass so it didn't blow me away or anything, but when I listened to The Call Of Ktulu, the night took a turn. ""Wait... THAT'S BASS?!"" I said to myself. Occasionally, you can hear Cliff's bass SCREAM and this entire time I thought it was Kirk's wah (excuse my ignorance). I further verified this by looking up bass enhanced versions of Ktulu but I further believed and could hear that it was Cliff and not Kirk once I listened to this version: Live at The Lyceum Theatre, London, UK - December 20th, 1984 (, ) Blown away is quite an understatement to describe what I felt once I was able to follow along with Cliff's bass during the entire track. I don't know if it's just because I haven't heard it before, but I just feel like Cliff's bass is much stronger here than Orion. It doesn't sound like it is from this world. It sounds almost intergalactic, from another planet, very alien, and intense. I was not able to hear the bass before but now here it is clear as day. HE PRETTY MUCH BASS SOLOS THE ENTIRE SONG AND I DID NOT HEAR ANY OF IT, 'TIL YESTERDAY, AFTER 3 YEARS OF LISTENING TO METALLICA. I ended up listening to Ktulu London 1984 for 4 hours straight along with live Anesthesia thrown in every now and again. This live version of Ktulu makes it so much easier to hear Cliff's bass playing, but I must say that I like the cleaner sound of the studio version... but it's so hard to hear... I've read a lot of people hyping over the S&amp;M(1) version, but when I listened to it, I was UNIMPRESSED with how Jason changed the bass. I don't hear the frightening, world ruling, Cthulu in his bass playing. A lot of it is mimicking how the song already sounds without the added flailing screams and growls of the bass that Cliff does. I can't deem S&amp;M1 the superior version. I feel like a lot of people like it more because they haven't heard the bass since you have to keep an ear out for it if you're not too keen on hearing it. They don't realize the strenh of the bass, the same ignorance I once had. S&amp;M2's version is amazing in comparison to S&amp;M1 because Rob gives a good homage to Cliff's playing on that version while Jason does not. Overall, Ktulu London 1984 is my definitive live version of Ktulu. I never quite understood the significance behind the name The Call Of Ktulu and its relevance to the song. I ended up realizing and imagining (before validating with other discussions) that James, Kirk, and Lars' instruments are chants (the repetitiveness) and Cliff's bass, calmly rising as he joins the others, raging and SCREAMING is the embodiment of Cthulu. The real meat of the song is Cthulu's yells and Cliff's interpretation of the beast. Cliff's intergalactic bass reassures that this creature is not of our world. Every Metallica instrumental is strong in their own right. They're all amazing, but from my discovery last night, as someone who once put Orion above all and was very close to putting To Live Is To Die at the top over it, I now declare that my favorite instrumental is The Call Of Ktulu. Thank you, Cliff Burton, for an amazing piece of work.",Been listening to Metallica for 3 Years and have ONLY NOW heard the bass on The Call Of Ktulu,t5_2qwwr,1640173639,1.0,KtuluBassBrah,0,i alway deem the call of ktulu as my least favorit instrument of metallica s due to it be repetit and not stand out as much but i couldn t have ever been more wrong in my 3 year of listen i ve heard a lot of talk about cliff burton s amaz bass play and i ve heard it clearli on anesthesia and orion but i have quit a hard time hear the bass in all of cliff s other studio work i don t think it s uncommon knowledg that metallica tend to buri their bass in mix so i don t think not hear the bass veri audibl is uncommon then i got high i don t smoke often that s whi thi is signifc i wa listen to one and start to notic that i wa abl to hear jason s bass a bit wait what the fuck i thought to myself as i mention earlier it s quit hard for me to hear bass play but seemingli in the album where the bass is the most hidden i wa abl to hear it i m posit that smoke made it easier for me to home in on the bass i had a fun idea to jump deeper into the heavi of bass by listen to orion i wa alreadi pretti familiar with orion s bass so it didn t blow me away or anyth but when i listen to the call of ktulu the night took a turn wait that s bass i said to myself occasion you can hear cliff s bass scream and thi entir time i thought it wa kirk s wah excus my ignor i further verifi thi by look up bass enhanc version of ktulu but i further believ and could hear that it wa cliff and not kirk onc i listen to thi version live at the lyceum theatr london uk decemb 20th 1984 blown away is quit an understat to describ what i felt onc i wa abl to follow along with cliff s bass dure the entir track i don t know if it s just becaus i haven t heard it befor but i just feel like cliff s bass is much stronger here than orion it doesn t sound like it is from thi world it sound almost intergalact from anoth planet veri alien and intens i wa not abl to hear the bass befor but now here it is clear as day he pretti much bass solo the entir song and i did not hear ani of it til yesterday after 3 year of

bass play but i must say that i like the cleaner sound of the studio version but it s so hard to hear i ve read a lot of peopl hype over the s amp m 1 version but when i listen to it i wa unimpress with how jason chang the bass i don t hear the frighten world rule cthulu in hi bass play a lot of it is mimick how the song alreadi sound without the ad flail scream and growl of the bass that cliff doe i can t deem s amp m1 the superior version i feel like a lot of peopl like it more becaus they haven t heard the bass sinc you have to keep an ear out for it if you re not too keen on hear it they don t realiz the strenh of the bass the same ignor i onc had s amp m2 s version is amaz in comparison to s amp m1 becaus rob give a good homag to cliff s play on that version while jason doe not overal ktulu london 1984 is my definit live version of ktulu i never quit understood the signific behind the name the call of ktulu and it relev to the song i end up realiz and imagin befor valid with other discuss that jame kirk and lar instrument are chant the repetit and cliff s bass calmli rise as he join the other rage and scream is the embodi of cthulu the real meat of the song is cthulu s yell and cliff s interpret of the beast cliff s intergalact bass reassur that thi creatur is not of our world everi metallica instrument is strong in their own right they re all amaz but from my discoveri last night as someon who onc put orion abov all and wa veri close to put to live is to die at the top over it i now declar that my favorit instrument is the call of ktulu thank you cliff burton for an amaz piec of work,been listen to metallica for 3 year and have onli now heard the bass on the call of ktulu,I always deemed The Call Of Ktulu a my least favorite instrumental of Metallica s due to it being repetitive and not standing out a much but I couldn t have ever been more wrong in my 3 year of listening I ve heard a lot of talk about Cliff Burton s amazing bass playing and I ve heard it clearly on Anesthesia and Orion but I have quite a hard time hearing the bass in all of Cliff s other studio work I don t think it s uncommon knowledge that Metallica tends to bury their bass in mixing so I don t think not hearing the bass very audibly is uncommon Then I got high I don t smoke often that s why this is signifcant I wa listening to One and started to notice that I wa able to hear Jason s bass a bit Wait what the fuck I thought to myself As I mentioned earlier it s quite hard for me to hear bass playing but seemingly in the album where the bass is the most hidden I wa able to hear it I m positive that smoking made it easier for me to home in on the bass I had a fun idea to jump deeper into the heaviness of bass by listening to Orion I wa already pretty familiar with Orion s bass so it didn t blow me away or anything but when I listened to The Call Of Ktulu the night took a turn Wait THAT S BASS I said to myself Occasionally you can hear Cliff s bass SCREAM and this entire time I thought it wa Kirk s wah excuse my ignorance I further verified this by looking up bass enhanced version of Ktulu but I further believed and could hear that it wa Cliff and not Kirk once I listened to this version Live at The Lyceum Theatre London UK December 20th 1984 Blown away is quite an understatement to describe what I felt once I wa able to follow along with Cliff s bass during the entire track I don t know if it s just because I haven t heard it before but I just feel like Cliff s bass is much stronger here than Orion It doesn t sound like it is from this world It sound almost intergalactic from another planet very alien and intense I wa not able to hear the bass before but now here it is clear a day HE PRETTY MUCH BASS SOLOS THE ENTIRE SONG AND I DID NOT HEAR ANY OF IT TIL YESTERDAY AFTER 3 YEARS OF LISTENING TO METALLICA I ended up listening to Ktulu London 1984 for 4 hour straight along with live Anesthesia thrown in every now and again This live version of Ktulu make it so much easier to hear Cliff s bass playing but I must say that I like the cleaner sound of the studio version but it s so hard to hear I ve read a lot of people hyping over the S amp M 1 version but when I listened to it I wa UNIMPRESSED with how Jason changed the bass I don t hear the frightening world ruling Cthulu in his bass playing A lot of it is mimicking how the song already sound without the added flailing scream and growl of the bass that Cliff doe I can t deem S amp M1 the superior version I feel like a lot of people like it more because they haven t heard the bass since you have to keep an ear out for it if you re not too keen on hearing it They don t realize the strenh of the bass the same ignorance I once had S amp M2 s version is amazing in comparison to S amp M1 because Rob give a good homage to Cliff s playing on that version while Jason doe not Overall Ktulu London 1984 is my definitive live version of Ktulu I never quite understood the significance behind the name The Call Of Ktulu and it relevance to the song I ended up realizing and imagining before validating with other discussion that James Kirk and Lars instrument are chant the repetitiveness and Cliff s bass calmly rising a he join the others raging and SCREAMING is the embodiment of Cthulu The real meat of the song is Cthulu s yell and Cliff s interpretation of the beast Cliff s intergalactic bass reassures that this creature is not of our world Every Metallica instrumental is strong in their own right They re all amazing but from my discovery last night a someone who once put Orion above all and wa very close to putting To Live Is To Die at the top over it I now declare that my favorite instrumental is The Call Of Ktulu Thank you Cliff Burton for an amazing piece of work,Been listening to Metallica for 3 Years and have ONLY NOW heard the bass on The Call Of Ktulu,I deemed The Call Of Ktulu favorite instrumental Metallica repetitive standing I wrong 3 year listening I heard lot talk Cliff Burton amazing bass playing I heard clearly Anesthesia Orion I quite hard time hearing bass Cliff studio work I think uncommon knowledge Metallica tends

Just like when I was in the 10th grade, I still play air guitar and sing along to ‚ÄòMaster of Puppets‚Äô. And I will keep playing air guitar to their songs for many more years. I still draw their logo on every piece of paper absent mindedly after all these years. I still dream of seeing them live and up close. Someday. Cheers to 40 years. Hope you're just getting started.

I purchased Hardwired To Self Destruct recently and everything sounded great until I got to the track ""Halo On Fire"". In the bridge of the song, the words ""Return To Sender"" skip no matter what. I even tried the same record on a friends record player just to confirm it was in fact the record and it did the same thing. I came to the conclusion that it was perhaps just a factory flaw.

Metallica,True,False,"Most parts of Lulu were bizarre, some were like meeting an old friend and then they shoot you in the face, and some of it was downright violating. Listening out of boredom was a terrible mistake, but mine to make. I tried to look at this as objectively as possible, as an art piece rather than Metallica. But even then, it's still horrible  Brandenburg Gate   2/10 - Starts with aggressive downright nonsensical acoustic strumming, then Reed starts speaking and you're wondering truly where the fuck you are. A brief silence and then the heaviness comes in, and hearing James scream SMALL TOWN GIRL makes me feel like James is my lost father and I haven't heard his voice since we thought he died in the war, it brings euphoria to hear someone actually sing. The lyrics are kind of hard to decipher, it literally opens with ""I would cut my legs and tits off"" and references classic horror film actors (Kirk?) but from what I can gather this has something to do with drug abuse. Anyways the track is pretty forgettable besides James screaming SMALL TOWN GIRL  The View   3/10 - This song gives false hope, it starts with a really heavy fucking riff and then Lou starts talking and its like well fuck nevermind that didnt last long. This song is a little more clear, it seems to just be about Satan and lust and desire. This song only gets points for the riff and I AM THE TABLE  Pumping Blood   1/10 - Barely know what the fuck this song is about, the riffs are nonsensical and chaotic. This entire track eventually just turns into screaming and guitars and snare smashing. I assume this is about somebody getting killed? This track has nothing going for it at all. Objectively a poor track.  Mistress Dread   2/10 - Again another nonsensical track of rambling. Lou's speech sounds like they literally took his voice from a completely different song and put it over an instrumental of some sort. Lyrics, again, are fucking weird. This seems to be about some sort of BDSM dominatrix lesbian relationship? The general theme of being used for someone else I guess. I don't really know. Lars thrashes on the drums for 5 straight fucking minutes, which is the only factor that gives this track a point.  Iced Honey   4/10 - Well, this song gets the most props yet. This sounds like it could be a legitimate song. Not a good one, but it has the basic elements of a song and Lou actually sounds like hes somewhat trying to match the melody of the song. The lyrics are pretty hard to get on this one, I assume it's about life and death in general though I can't be certain.  Cheat on Me   1/10 - Yea this is where experimental goes down the drain. This song has a listed time of 11 minutes, but do not be fooled, it takes over 3 minutes to hear anything that doesnt sound like a broken soundcheck. It takes 5 and a half minutes for any coherent guitar riff to come in. Lars' drums are practically the music here because the guitars keep going from something sort of strung together to nonsensical strumming pedal effect shit. I assume this song has something to do with some guy who cheats and fucks himself up, and he has no passion and can't stay with one person for long.  Frustration   3/10 - The beginning of this sounds like the opening credits of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre from 1974. It breaks into a really fucking cool riff. I think the lyrics are like, a girl he likes but she's with someone else, and shes more dominant than he is? The lyrics again are fucking weird and begin to get a little more obscene here. This song gets point for having a really cool riff and the lyrics being a little more coherent and strung along. There is some weird breaks of no music where I feel like I'm listening to a serial killer audio tape.  Little Dog   -1000000000/10 - If such a thing as auditory rape was possible, this song would be the textbook definition. This is not a song, this is guitar strumming to extremely disturbing poetry I do not want to hear from an old mans mouth. I felt legitimately violated after listening to this track. Little Dog should be banished to the pits of hell.  Dragon   4/10 - Finally, the music returns. The guitar riff on this is interesting, and this is a lot more aggressive sounding which gets it some points. I think this song is about being in a relationship with a narcissist who thinks they're better than you. The lyrics are repetitive, but you've accepted their surreal nature at this point. This song fills up the 11 minute time slot a little more.  Junior Dad   - The titan of this track, clocking in at a mind numbing 19 minutes and 28 seconds. You have to have quite an attention span for this one, for while the riff is cool, it certainly goes on for a loooooong time. I can't make out its meaning. I suppose this could be considered the instrumental of Lulu, because the majority of this song is just that. After around 10 or 11 minutes the song just sort of turns to what sounds like one of those ""deep sleep relaxation"" videos of the slow harmonic music. I took this part of Junior Dad to reflect back on the hour long journey of Lulu and how much of a mistake it was. Realizing I gained nothing from the experience. But it's a relaxing moment of clarity to know it's all over, and a Lulu is done. This is the rest of the song, and it gets the best score. Because Lulu is finally fucking over. The scariest part of this entire track is that there is synced lyrics on Spotify, meaning others have listened to this shit in full to sync it up. God rest them. What is Lulu? I don't know, I didn't learn jack shit from the straight hour of listening. If Lars was right and this album will be hailed in 30 years from its time, then I think I'll stop listening to music.",A review of the entirety of Lulu. So you don't ever listen to it.,t5_2qwwr,1639450759,1.0,SamooraiSoldia,0,most part of lulu were bizarr some were like meet an old friend and then they shoot you in the face and some of it wa downright

Metallica,True,False,"The last post I made of this got a good amount of likes, and I have plenty of time in between college semesters, so what better way than to kill time than listing off the bottom 3 songs on the NEXT 5 albums? Let's go. I think this one will be more interesting, since the quality of these albums and their songs are much more debated than the previous original 5. Admittedly, I had to relisten to a lot of these songs cause I only generally listen to the more popular or more niche tracks off these albums. LOAD  Ronnie (7.9 million plays) 5/10 - Ronnie is a very interesting track. It has a sort of more upbeat groovy blues feel, however the lyrics entail a young boy who becomes a school shooter on his ""bloody day"". I like this song, however I also understand why Metallica has never played this song life, especially with Columbine happening 3 years after the release of Load and the prevalence of school shootings happening more. I don't think Ronnie will ever be played period. Also James' country twang dialogue break in the middle is pretty funny, but 50% of Load is country twang.  Thorn Within (5 million plays) 9/10 - Badass song, and it may get some extra points because I can relate to this one in some ways. I am very sad to see this track has never been played, I think it definitely should get some more recognition, it also has some cool little drum fill parts and is in general a nice slow burn song, fitting for the Load era.  Poor Twisted Me (4.8 million plays) 4/10 - The first song in my listings to break under 5. I will admit, this song is actually one of my guilty pleasures, also partially because I can relate to the lyrics. However, this song is so basic, just a slow guitar riff with a basic drum beat, and some really fucking weird distorted vocals. This song could be played by a middle school cover band. Poor Twisted Me is a very niche song that I personally enjoy, but certainly think it earns it's place at the bottom of Load, and one of the least played Metallica songs in general. RELOAD  Where The Wild Things Are (4.8 million plays) 7/10 - Jason, betrayed once again for his last own contribution to a Metallica album before his departure. This song does have some really cool riffs and interesting lyrical theme, based off the book of the same name. I think it could definitely topple some other tracks off Reload, though it's slower tempo and slow intro likely contributes to it's falling short. The change around 4:30 sounds really badass though, and the solo preceding it.  Prince Charming (4.8 million plays) 4/10 - This song just kinda... chugs through. A lot of it is spoken rather than sung, this is like a storytelling song, but the story isn't all that interesting. This song is about a drug addict from what I can gather. The solo sounds like a robot being mauled, and the drums are just pushing their way through rather than being the songs driver. Very meh track, even the slow temp breakdown which I am usually a big fan of isn't that appealing to me.  Attitude (4.1 million plays) 6/10 - Groovy hard rock song, nothing metal about this song. The beginning feels like I could be listening to an AC/DC track. It's got some aggressive lyrics, and a pretty cool riff to boot. This track is nothing crazy, I think it should only be higher than Prince Charming. ST. ANGER  My World (4.6 million plays) 5/10 - I think this song is definitely one of those on St. Anger that does not benefit from that snare, the drum intro could actually sound pretty badass if it wasn't for the ear piercing ringing striking your ears. This song, much like all the other St. Anger songs, has so many repeating verses it will make you feel madly in anger. This song is just there, the guitar riff in between reverses is kinda cool, but it's just sort of shoved in there. The track ends with ""enough's enough,"" which is my sentiment exactly.  All Within My Hands (4.2 million plays) 7/10 - I actually like this song and think it benefits from the snare sound, I really like the slow builds and it's a bit more of an experimental song. Despite the charity of the same name, barely anyone listens to this song. I think it's solid and one of the more tolerable tracks from St. Anger. This song is also long as fuck, being one of the longest that's not just a straight up instrumental. The songs lyrics are very dark, choking and killing your family and loved ones that you already controlled and manipulated. This definitely had a lot of James writing and is a lot of aggression and self hatred coming out here. This song gets docked down because holy fuck, 8 and a half minutes too long. This song could have easily been 4 minutes. Point goes up for the image of James in the studio just screaming kill into the mic over and over.  Purify (3.9 million views) 5/10 - Bones, bones, bones. This is an interesting song. James is just frantically screaming over a track, the guitar isn't doing too much a lot of the times. The main riff is pretty cool, but again like many guitar riffs in St. Anger, it feels sort of janky and misplaced. This, being one of the last songs on the album, Purify has a LOT of snare going on, and sometimes when I'm listening to the verses, it literally sounds like it's drilling my skull. Purify can stay at the bottom, the lyrical theme is again about James' addiction, but I think All Within My Hands attacks it in a more dark and tolerable way. Pure if I and Purify is a clever wordplay though. DEATH MAGNETIC  That Was Just Your Life (14.2 million plays) 10/10 - Being the opening track of the semi-return to thrash is no easy feat. But personally, I fucking love That Was Just Your Life, badass opening, nonstop in your face lyrics about PTSD. Double bass in the intro, and great singing from James as he was finally mastering his singing in this era. I get Death Magnetic is generally overlooked, but I didn't expect an opening track to get such a low play count.  Suicide and Redemption (10.4 million plays) 10/10 - How in the fuck Suicide and Redemption has such a low amount of plays bewilders me, this is the return to the instrumentals for Metallica and it doesn't disappoint. It changes around a lot, features some of Lars' more creative and ""drummer-like"" drum fills, and you can even argue this is his only real studio track with a drum solo. The song is VERY long, at just under 10 minutes long, and I do believe some parts can drag on for a bit longer than they need to, but Suicide and Redemption is a song that weaves a story. I love the little riff around 3:50 that's very simple, but gives the song a nice middle somber break. I sort of imagine the beginning as the character of this story building up the adrenaline for the ""suicide,"" then the slower break in 3:50 is the aftermath of his end, the song regains it's tempo which is sort of like him rising from the dead as the slow somber riff has turned faster and more aggressive, then turns into a more vengeful sounding song, perhaps this character is looking for redemption that he could not find in his life. James' solo is also amazing on this song, up there with some of his best, I even love Kirk's wah screaming on this song, and the little up and down that begins before James' solo.  The Judas Kiss (10 million plays) 9/10 - Judas Kiss is definitely one of Metallica's sleeper songs, the lowest played off DM but this song still slaps. Return to biblical themes like Creeping Death, badass heavy riff featured in this song, and the buildup to the solo in the song is pretty cool, even if the solo is kinda lackluster, I think it serves the song, and it also feels like old Metallica. The song gets fucking brutally fast as the solo approaches the end and some double bass gets incorporated in there. HARDWIRED... TO SELF DESTRUCT  Murder One (15.5 million plays) 8/10 - I'll preface by saying I love Hardwired for all it's tributes to the past, Murder One namely being a tribute to Lemmy of Motorhead, the Confusion intro clearly being a tribute to Am I Evil, and the drum intro of Atlas, Rise honestly sounds like the baby of the Dyers Eve drum intro to me. Anyways, Murder One has a sick heavy riff, and one of Kirk's more coherent solos in recent times. This song has definitely lost some credit, as it tends to be a little slower compared to the rest of HTSD.  ManUNkind (14.8 million plays) 9/10 - I will admit it here, I am a sucker for ManUNkind, I love the bass intro and the badass heavy buildup which was clearly Kirk's idea for that easy heavy riff, but it works so well, and Metallica has built a lot of bangers on simplicity. This song is yet another tribute to Mayhem, evident especially in the music video for this song. I feel this song is one that the bandmembers really like, but hasn't been so unfavorable with the audience. I definitely believe this song deserves more credit, but perhaps it is my own bias. This song is fun to play, and sing at the same time.  Am I Savage? (14.3 million plays) 10/10 - Metallica loves their blues, and it's evident on Am I Savage, with a title that may be inspired from Am I Evil. This song is a very groovy and heavy song off Hardwired, and the lyrics are very interesting, continuing the narrative from Of Wolf And Man, this time talking about the character passing on his traits to his children. Am I Savage is definitely underrated, and even took a couple listens for me to get on board with completely. And that concludes it, if this post gets enough traction as well, I will listen to the entirety of fucking Lulu and give rank reviews to that album as well. Feel free to leave any opinions in the comments.","Rating the bottom 3 songs, in order of popularity, on the latest 5 Metallica albums (according to Spotify

give rank review to that album as well feel free to leav ani opinion in the comment,rate the bottom 3 song in order of popular on the latest 5 metallica album accord to spotifi metric,The last post I made of this got a good amount of like and I have plenty of time in between college semester so what better way than to kill time than listing off the bottom 3 song on the NEXT 5 album Let s go I think this one will be more interesting since the quality of these album and their song are much more debated than the previous original 5 Admittedly I had to relisten to a lot of these song cause I only generally listen to the more popular or more niche track off these album LOAD Ronnie 7 9 million play 5 10 Ronnie is a very interesting track It ha a sort of more upbeat groovy blue feel however the lyric entail a young boy who becomes a school shooter on his bloody day I like this song however I also understand why Metallica ha never played this song life especially with Columbine happening 3 year after the release of Load and the prevalence of school shooting happening more I don t think Ronnie will ever be played period Also James country twang dialogue break in the middle is pretty funny but 50 of Load is country twang Thorn Within 5 million play 9 10 Badass song and it may get some extra point because I can relate to this one in some way I am very sad to see this track ha never been played I think it definitely should get some more recognition it also ha some cool little drum fill part and is in general a nice slow burn song fitting for the Load era Poor Twisted Me 4 8 million play 4 10 The first song in my listing to break under 5 I will admit this song is actually one of my guilty pleasure also partially because I can relate to the lyric However this song is so basic just a slow guitar riff with a basic drum beat and some really fucking weird distorted vocal This song could be played by a middle school cover band Poor Twisted Me is a very niche song that I personally enjoy but certainly think it earns it s place at the bottom of Load and one of the least played Metallica song in general RELOAD Where The Wild Things Are 4 8 million play 7 10 Jason betrayed once again for his last own contribution to a Metallica album before his departure This song doe have some really cool riff and interesting lyrical theme based off the book of the same name I think it could definitely topple some other track off Reload though it s slower tempo and slow intro likely contributes to it s falling short The change around 4 30 sound really badass though and the solo preceding it Prince Charming 4 8 million play 4 10 This song just kinda chug through A lot of it is spoken rather than sung this is like a storytelling song but the story isn t all that interesting This song is about a drug addict from what I can gather The solo sound like a robot being mauled and the drum are just pushing their way through rather than being the song driver Very meh track even the slow temp breakdown which I am usually a big fan of isn t that appealing to me Attitude 4 1 million play 6 10 Groovy hard rock song nothing metal about this song The beginning feel like I could be listening to an AC DC track It s got some aggressive lyric and a pretty cool riff to boot This track is nothing crazy I think it should only be higher than Prince Charming ST ANGER My World 4 6 million play 5 10 I think this song is definitely one of those on St Anger that doe not benefit from that snare the drum intro could actually sound pretty badass if it wasn t for the ear piercing ringing striking your ear This song much like all the other St Anger song ha so many repeating verse it will make you feel madly in anger This song is just there the guitar riff in between revers is kinda cool but it s just sort of shoved in there The track end with enough s enough which is my sentiment exactly All Within My Hands 4 2 million play 7 10 I actually like this song and think it benefit from the snare sound I really like the slow build and it s a bit more of an experimental song Despite the charity of the same name barely anyone listens to this song I think it s solid and one of the more tolerable track from St Anger This song is also long a fuck being one of the longest that s not just a straight up instrumental The song lyric are very dark choking and killing your family

Metallica,True,False,"These metrics come from Spotify, but likely give a good indicator of the least popular songs on each album. For a general metric, any score above 5/10 indicates I believe the song should have more plays, and under is an indication of believing it should have lower plays. KILL 'EM ALL  Metal Miltia (16.1 million plays) 7/10 - I personally love this song, and the nonstop thrash, however I understand why this song may not be as appealing to more common fans. This song is nonstop thrash and the lyrics are pretty much intelligible besides METAL MILITIA  Anesthesia (13.3 million plays) 9/10 - Ok, so obviously bass solos aren't what people generally look for when they think of Metallica, but Anesthesia is one of the most revered and badass bass solos in metal history. The only point that comes off is because I understand not everyone wants to hear a bass solo for 4 minutes.  Phantom Lord (11.9 million plays) 8/10 - Phantom Lord suffers from what I call ""slow startup syndrome,"" meaning the song is generally skipped because the intro is a slow buildup, which from what I've seen in the playing numbers usually effects how much the song is played. Anyways, this song is criminally underrated, and if you listen to the lyrics you realize how badass it is. Phantom Lord gets almost 0 discussion, I would say it's one of the least mentioned Metallica songs I've ever heard. The solos on it are a little funky, but it's still a driving thrash song. It has a nice melodic break in the middle of it, which was an early indicator of their great songwriting ability. RIDE THE LIGHTNING  The Call of Ktulu (32.5 million plays) 9/10 - Another song that suffers from slow startup syndrome, The Call of Ktulu was one of my favorite songs for a long period of time, give the chance to listen to it and you will be blown away. The riffs, the roaring bass, and the drums are coming together to create this scene where I can imagine Cthulhu bursting from the ground and fighting a set of warriors. When a piece of music gives you a vivid head image, you know it's something special.  Trapped Under Ice (24.2 million plays) 6/10 - This song is not one of my favorites, however it's very underplayed especially compared to the rest of Ride the Lightning. It is a nice thrashy song with some lyrics that may have been a predecessor to One.  Escape (22.3 million plays) 5/10 - The first song I don't believe should be higher or lower, I think Escape earns the place at the bottom of Ride the Lightning. Despite this song made to be radio friendly, it is the forgotten stepchild of RTL. It's Metallica, you can tell, but something about it feels... off. MASTER OF PUPPETS  The Thing That Should Not Be (33.3 million plays) 8/10 - Slow startup syndrome, The Thing That Should Not Be is a slower song, but it definitely deserves some credit. Cthulhu can't seem to win with his songs, but this song has nice slow parts and then buildups. It's not so thrashy though which encompasses MOP.  Damage, Inc. (26.8 million plays) 10/10 - WTF? DAMAGE INC? This one actually caught me off guard, cause I just always assumed Damage, Inc was one of the more popular songs. Slow startup syndrome strikes here, but it's unbelievable, Damage Inc is a classic thrash song and one of the best off MOP.  Leper Messiah (24.1 million plays) 9/10 - Definitely underrated. Insanely heavy groovy riff with some awesome drumming to boot. James' vocals swivel around the riff masterfully and makes it sounds very appealing to the ears. Should definitely not be as low as it is. AND JUSTICE FOR ALL  Dyers Eve (25.1 million plays) 10/10 - Classic thrash with borderline insane drumming, this song requires a fuckton of stamina for EVERY part. The drums, guitars, vocals, and bass are all insanely fast on Dyers Eve. Like Damage, Inc. I was very surprised to see this song so low.  The Frayed Ends of Sanity (23.5 million plays) 10/10 - How could you not love the Wizard of Oz caveman chant intro on this song? This song has some great riffs, solos, and a very cool but simple drum break in the middle of the song, and amazing vocals. Very underrated.  To Live is To Die (20.4 million plays) 10/10 - Whatever bastard let this masterpiece become one of the least played songs should be executed. I understand instrumentals are not everyone's thing, and I think the reason it's so low is because To Live is To Die is for the true fan, to feel the pain of Cliff's passing and all the emotion that came with it. It's a niche played one for a reason, but it still has some amazing riffs and creativity. The slow somber riff break around 4:30 in the song always gets me. Beautiful song. THE BLACK ALBUM  My Friend of Misery (31.3 million plays) 10/10 - Jason done dirty once again. The one true pride he has on an album has been disgraced to the bottom 3 somehow. Yes I am aware of Where the Wild Things Are and that song is amazing as well, but ReLoad obviously did not reach the titanic prospects that the Black Album did. The bassline in this song is wonderful, and actually fun and easy to play on bass yourself. The feeling it encompasses is exactly as the title does, pure misery. I do wish this song booted off the vocals, James' self proclaimed ""improving"" of the song, but I can appreciate the vocals as well.  The God That Failed (30 million plays) 10/10 - Insanely low and heavy riff, one of my original favorites from my first listen through of TBA. This song should 100% be higher. Badass riff, and great lyrics you can feel the soul of. ""The healing hand held back by the deepened nail"" is one of my favorite wordplays on this song.  The Struggle Within (19.2 million plays) 8/10 - The last on the list of TBA, left to be forgotten. From what I hear, this is the fastest song on TBA, and features Lars if he got on the drumline in highschool for the intro. This song is a little more distinct from the rest of the album, which is why I speculate it's a lot lower, it's one of the least played songs period and it came from their largest album. This song has a pretty cool solo about midway through as well. This only covers the first 5 albums because of word limit, but if people like this post, I'll finish rating the rest for Load, RELoad, St. Anger, DM, and HTSD.","Rating the bottom 3 songs, in order of

popular on the origin 5 classic metallica album accord to spotifi metric,These metric come from Spotify but likely give a good indicator of the least popular song on each album For a general metric any score above 5 10 indicates I believe the song should have more play and under is an indication of believing it should have lower play KILL EM ALL Metal Miltia 16 1 million play 7 10 I personally love this song and the nonstop thrash however I understand why this song may not be a appealing to more common fan This song is nonstop thrash and the lyric are pretty much intelligible besides METAL MILITIA Anesthesia 13 3 million play 9 10 Ok so obviously bass solo aren t what people generally look for when they think of Metallica but Anesthesia is one of the most revered and badass bass solo in metal history The only point that come off is because I understand not everyone want to hear a bass solo for 4 minute Phantom Lord 11 9 million play 8 10 Phantom Lord suffers from what I call slow startup syndrome meaning the song is generally skipped because the intro is a slow buildup which from what I ve seen in the playing number usually effect how much the song is played Anyways this song is criminally underrated and if you listen to the lyric you realize how badass it is Phantom Lord get almost 0 discussion I would say it s one of the least mentioned Metallica song I ve ever heard The solo on it are a little funky but it s still a driving thrash song It ha a nice melodic break in the middle of it which wa an early indicator of their great songwriting ability RIDE THE LIGHTNING The Call of Ktulu 32 5 million play 9 10 Another song that suffers from slow startup syndrome The Call of Ktulu wa one of my favorite song for a long period of time give the chance to listen to it and you will be blown away The riff the roaring bass and the drum are coming together to create this scene where I can imagine Cthulhu bursting from the ground and fighting a set of warrior When a piece of music give you a vivid head image you know it s something special Trapped Under Ice 24 2 million play 6 10 This song is not one of my favorite however it s very underplayed especially compared to the rest of Ride the Lightning It is a nice thrashy song with some lyric that may have been a predecessor to One Escape 22 3 million play 5 10 The first song I don t believe should be higher or lower I think Escape earns the place at the bottom of Ride the Lightning Despite this song made to be radio friendly it is the forgotten stepchild of RTL It s Metallica you can tell but something about it feel off MASTER OF PUPPETS The Thing That Should Not Be 33 3 million play 8 10 Slow startup syndrome The Thing That Should Not Be is a slower song but it definitely deserves some credit Cthulhu can t seem to win with his song but this song ha nice slow part and then buildup It s not so thrashy though which encompasses MOP Damage Inc 26 8 million play 10 10 WTF DAMAGE INC This one actually caught me off guard cause I just always assumed Damage Inc wa one of the more popular song Slow startup syndrome strike here but it s unbelievable Damage Inc is a classic thrash song and one of the best off MOP Leper Messiah 24 1 million play 9 10 Definitely underrated Insanely heavy groovy riff with some awesome drumming to boot James vocal swivel around the riff masterfully and make it sound very appealing to the ear Should definitely not be a low a it is AND JUSTICE FOR ALL Dyers Eve 25 1 million play 10 10 Classic thrash with borderline insane drumming this song requires a fuckton of stamen for EVERY part The drum guitar vocal and bass are all insanely fast on Dyers Eve Like Damage Inc I wa very surprised to see this song so low The Frayed Ends of Sanity 23 5 million play 10 10 How could you not love the Wizard of Oz caveman chant intro on this song This song ha some great riff solo and a very cool but simple drum break in the middle of the song and amazing vocal Very underrated To Live is To Die 20 4 million play 10 10 Whatever bastard let this masterpiece become one of the least played song should be executed I understand instrumentals are not everyone s thing and I think the reason it s so low is because To Live is To Die is for the true fan to feel the pain of Cliff s passing and all the emotion that came with it It s a niche played one for a reason but it still ha some amazing riff and creativity The slow somber riff break around 4 30 in the song always get me Beautiful song THE BLACK ALBUM My Friend of Misery 31 3 million play 10 10 Jason done dirty once again The one true pride he ha on an album ha been disgraced to the bottom 3 somehow Yes I am aware of Where the Wild Things Are and that song is amazing a well but ReLoad obviously did not reach the titanic prospect that the Black Album did The bassline in this song is wonderful and actually fun and easy to play on bass yourself The feeling it encompasses is exactly a the title doe pure misery I do wish this song booted off the vocal James self proclaimed improving of the song but I can appreciate the vocal a well The God That Failed 30 million play 10 10 Insanely low and heavy riff one of my

on the drumline in highschool for the intro This song is a little more distinct from the rest of the album which is why I speculate it s a lot lower it s one of the least played song period and it

Metallica,True,False,"After it was announced that the two 40th anniversary shows will be streamed live on Amazon Video there was some concern from some ticket holders that being streamed live for all to see would somehow change the format of the show from being a show full of deep cuts, hidden gems and special guests to more of a traditional concert format with the standard setlist. First of all, I don't really think that the live stream announcement really changed anything. The shows next week were always going to be how they're going to be. I'm sure that was planned well in advance. It's not like they just came up with this live stream idea and then changed the show format. I'm sure the band has known for months exactly how the shows are going to down next week and I'm sure the business side had already contracted to stream the shows a long time ago. They just didn't want to announce it until closer to the shows. So nothing changed, I'm sure. If these 40th anniversary shows don't happen exactly like the 30th anniversary shows, think about it. The 30th shows took place at the Fillmore Theater in san Francisco. A smaller, more intimate venue. More conducive to talking and being more interactive with the audience. The 40th shows are taking place in a full blown 20,000 seat arena. It's just going to be a different feel, a different vibe altogether. So will it be as chock full of deep cuts and special guests as the 30th shows 10 years ago? Obviously, I don't know. But my guess would be no. Not quite like the last anniversary celebration. If for no other reason than the size of the venue this time around. But at the same time, I also don't think that the shows are going to be regular, routine standard shows/setlists either. Of course there will be hidden gems, guests and surprises -- just maybe not quite to the extent of 10 years ago since that was the first time they had done a celebration show like that. Those are just my thoughts. I guess I would say that I anticipate it falling somewhere in between the 30th year anniversary shows 10 years ago and a normal Metallica concert. Somewhere in the middle of the two. But that still kicks ass, right? I personally think so. It'll definitely be more talkative and more festive than a regular concert. Agree/disagree? What are your predictions? Do you feel that Jason or Dave will show up this time around? Who else do you think might show up? I think Jason probably will, not sure about Dave. I mean, he did it once which was epic but don't know if it would happen again. Just because they've done it. Then again, I don't believe that Megadeth is doing any shows at the moment so Dave's schedule seems like it would allow it. I would be stoked if he showed up. The more the merrier. I want all kinds of special guests I just don't know that it will be quite the same as the one 10 years ago. Your thoughts, predictions, song requests? They did Whiskey in the Jar at that PPV fight a few weeks ago, would love it if they played Astronomy or Mercyful Fate at one of these shows.",40th Anniversary Shows opinions &amp;

Metallica,True,False,"Metallica has had 3 (or kinda four) offcial bassists: Ron McGovney, Cliff Burton, Jason Newsted and Robert Trujillo. Each of them has co-written riffs for Metallica. Every bassist will be remembered as a part of Metallica's career, by the fans. Especially Cliff. Here is the thing that I have had in my head for awhile: I think Metallica likes Rob the most, music wise, otherwise it could have been Jason, I think (he was in the band for over 15 years, so that really explains how much they liked Jason as a person, although he did receive some bad behaviour from Lars, Kirk and James). Another thing: Robert has been almost 19 years in the band, so that more than Jason, could also be about his kindness and attitude for the band. He also brought his stage presence and music composing powers to the light very early. His crab walking and stuff... So did Jason. Everytime he went on stage, you could tell he loved being there. At the time he was in the band, the 90's were his time to ""shine"". He didn't spare his energy on stage. He was so interesting and enthusiastic. He just...I cannot even explain it, just watch some live footage from Monsters of Rock Tour and S&amp;M, and 90's live in general. I mentioned that Rob has composed some riffs. The ManUNKind intro melody was composed by Rob, during the Death Magnetic sessions Speaking of DM, if you are familiar with the song, All Nightmare Long, and you have watched the video where Robert plays acoustic guitar. From that video, came at least 2 riffs for the song. (Watch that video, and you'll see) Let's get to the live stuff now. Talking about Metallica's first instrumentals (Anesthesia, Ktulu, Orion, To Live): Metallica did not play any of those FULLY live, when Cliff and Jason were around. Surely, they did fractions of Orion in thd 90's (the interlude with the bass riff and the guitar harmonies), but not entirely so... All the instrumental, literally everone of them, were played live (for the first timd fully) with Robert Trujillo. Anesthesia in 2013 Orion in 2006 The Call of Ktulu in (to my knowledge) in 2010's To Live is To Die in 2011. That's all.

although he did receive some bad behaviour from Lars Kirk and James Another thing Robert ha been almost 19 year in the band so that more than Jason could also be about his kindness and attitude for the band He also brought his stage presence and music composing power to the light very early His crab walking and stuff So did Jason Everytime he went on stage you could tell he loved being there At the time he wa in the band the 90 s were his time to shine He didn t spare his energy on stage He wa so interesting and enthusiastic He just I cannot even explain it just watch some live footage from

Metallica,True,False,"So people have brought this up multiple times before, but I just wanted to point some things out because they've missed a couple of things. So we all know that they have a pattern for what order the songs go in a track, AKA a track listing. In that, they usually open the album with a melodic intro that transitions into a thrashy song, such as Fight Fire with Fire, Battery, Blackened, Enter Sandman, and arguably; This Was Just Your Life. The second song is usually the title track if the album has one, such as RTL, MoP, AJFA, and St. Anger. Track three is usually slower than the rest of the album and is reserved for experimental songs, such as Bell Tolls, which is slow, has a longer intro, and simpler guitar solos; The Thing That Should Not Be, which is slow, has clean guitar on a non-ballad, and has a short guitar solo; Eye of the Beholder, which is slow and has multiple changes in tempo and time signature; and Broken, Beat, and Scarred, which is slow. Track four is usually a ballad, such as Fade to Black, Welcome Home, One, The Unforgiven, Until it Sleeps, The Unforgiven II, and The Day That Never Comes. If there is an instrumental, it is usually the second-to-last track, such as Orion, TLITD, Suicide &amp; Redemption, and technically My Friend of Misery, given that it was intended to be an instrumental. The album closer is usually faster than the rest of the album, such as Metal Militia, Damage Inc., Dyers Eve, The Struggle Within, arguably My Apocalypse, and Spit Out the Bone. However, there have been a few times where Metallica has broken this pattern. Such cases include HTSD, where the title track was first instead of second. The opener also did not include a melodic intro. They also included the lyrics, ""Death Magnetic"" in the song My Apocalypse, making it a title track of sorts. Don't Tread on Me is a sort of title track to the Black Album, as the snake in the corner matches that of The Gadsden Flag with the same snake and the words, ""Don't Tread on Me."" The song was not the second track of the album. There were times where Metallica didn't have a melodic intro for the first song, such as Hit the Lights, Ain't My Bitch, Fuel, Frantic, and Hardwired. Additionally, they had times where the ballad wasn't on the fourth track, such as Nothing Else Matters, Low Man's Lyric, Mama Said, The Unforgiven III, and arguably, Halo on Fire. They also had cases where the instrumental was not the second-to-last song on the album, such as Pulling Teeth and The Call of Ktulu. They also have had the third song faster than the rest of the album instead of slower, such as Holier Than Thou. Lastly, they've had the album closer be slower, as opposed to faster than the rest of the album, such as The Outlaw Torn, Fixxxer, The Call of Ktulu, and All Within My Hands.

Yes, Enter Sandman and Nothing else matters are overplayed but you can‚Äôt say that arguably two of the biggest songs of all time are bad and they aren‚Äôt. And I just fell in love with Don‚Äôt Tread on me, Through the never, Of wolf and Man.

And like I got bored of Enter Sandman and Nothing else matters, I got bored of Master of Puppets, One, Blackened, Creeping death. And finally the biggest difference, the sound of this record. Holy fuck. Listening in a good headphone will actually blow your mind the quality of Sound in guitar, James voice (this is prime James‚Äôs voice idgaf what anyone else says) and that fucking snare of Lars holy shit.

Metallica,True,False,"Thought of this last night while I was very tired. I saw someone make a post a couple weeks ago saying imagine if Metallica just did one song for an hour and then left. That would be the whole show. Well, a somewhat similar concept: Imagine if Metallica played a show where they did EVERY song in order, from every album in order, but more like a medley rather than just playing every song start to finish and leading into the next. Since that would make the concert 87 hours long (not that I have a problem with that but SOME people might, for some reason). Like for example, start with KEA, somehow condense all songs into, like, 20 minutes, with one flowing into the next (if Rob Scallon can play EVERY Metallica song EVER in 4 minutes then Metallica themselves could play a medley of all their songs in a 2 hour concert lmao). Start with a medley of KEA, then talk to the audience, then medley of RTL, and so on. Extra points if they can somehow combine all the album medleys together to make it one big medley so we get stuff like Dyer's Eve flowing into Enter Sandman and whatnot. Maybe James could talk to us during an instrumental break instead. Make sense? No? Good. I need an energy drink. Epic or stupid? Would you see that show?

Metallica,True,False,"Hey everyone, I know this has probably been posted before but I wanted to submit my personal playlist I use to listen to Load/Reload! I call it Overload: 1. Fuel 2.

Still really long, but I think more manageable in its lenh than either Load or Reload by itself due to a larger variety between the songs and a stronger flow and concept. My version of Overload turns Load/Reload into a slower, more brooding and melodic version of the albums we got. I always dug this side of the two albums, so by combining the tracks that carry this vibe I think I've got my personal perfect version. I also think this flows really well and tells a very complete story. I personally prefer this mixture of these two albums to The Black Album. I've always loved the warm and full sound of these two albums' production, as well as the bluesy riffage and in my opinion, James' strongest vocal performances.
